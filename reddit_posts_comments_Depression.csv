**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",Understood and I apologise if I forget in the future and break it

I know that people mean well but sometimes it’s better to let the person vent and make that person feel understood instead of trying to change that person and make him/her happier. 

I feel that forced positivity has a worse effect on me than sad posts. It’s hard for people without mental illnesses to understand that. 

Sorry for my rambling. That’s my two cents on the topic."

I’ve never thought about things you said but you made some great points.   
  
And even as I didn’t think about it I still felt like this type of comments were unnecessary. Like most of them aren’t ready to commit to having a thoughtful conversation but they comment anyway.  
  
It is also very hard for a person who struggles with depression to initiate a conversation. “PM me anytime” isn’t an initiation. OP should write the first PM which is very hard as many would feel like they are bothering the commenter are that they don’t deserve the time and attention.  
  
It would only make sense if people first made a comment about OP’s situation or thoughts, ask some questions and only then end their message with “PM me if you want to answer privately”. Now OP won’t feel bad for PM-ing someone because the commenter asked them a question so OP doesn’t initiate a conversation — it has already been initiated. As you said, it’s better not to offer to PM and as it’s a rule now nobody should do it — I’m just saying that this was one of the reasons to implement the rule so if someone is commenting on another similar subreddit (where “PM me” is allowed) try to write more than that, ask questions and discuss the topic before you offer to PM.  
  
Also seeing the same, standardized answers (even if some important meaning is hiding behind them) may make you feel really bad both as an OP or as a lurker. It makes you feel like nobody really cares about strangers’ problems."

That's why I try to only reply to posts when I'm up and only make posts when I'm down (don't try to look for them I use multiple accounts and delete old posts and so should you guys for the sake of not being discriminated against for your problems, which are normal and sometimes feel extreme and can make the general public react to you irrationally because they don't understand).

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support.

Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.","I really appreciate this post! 

As someone who's posted here, I've received a few PMs that started off with the usual: ""Hey, how are you? I felt like you needed to talk to someone.""

I really appreciated the sentiment, but it felt like a forced interaction. Not without care or consideration, but catered specifically to be a body to talk to and knowing the intention behind it, ironically made me feel obligated to politely respond, but pussyfooted (for a lack of a better word) in my attitude. 

This is only because I know it's a sincere, but more importantly, an instantly sympathetic reaction to a sad post. It's not something I expect to be a meaningful, lasting relationship, but one born for a moment out of immediate sympathy. Like a hand on the shoulder. 

I do appreciate them. I really do, but I also can do without it, and like the moderators here have said, comments are all I need. Commiserating, advice for me or anybody relating to the OP, or a simple upvote to show support is really all I'm looking for. If a meaningful online interaction \*naturally\* precipitates, I'm all for it. I hope I'm not being too sensitive, but hey... I guess that's why I'm here haha"
"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.

Especially earlier this year when I started therapy and found this sub I wanted to feel better and helping others or the though of helping others aided me in that; 
I fell into the “I want to feel helpful” category despite my best intentions.

I did end up having a private conversation with someone, helping them as best I could, as often as I could and it started of pretty good no matter the time or topic. However, a couple days in I was out of advice and at a low point myself. The conversations came to a screeching halt - they couldn’t help me and I couldn’t help them. Their issues had transformed into (or had always been about) something entirely different than their original post posited and I turned into a helpee myself instead of a helper. We both went our separate ways none the better. 

After that I never replied regarding dm’s and kept it to comment chains only.

Thank you for doing this and thank you for your work, this is a safe place which sometimes might need protecting from itself. After all, in the haze of my own misery and thoughts I never properly read the rules and just.. reached out."

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.","Here’s my story and experience with this- I posted on SW a long time ago and was targeted by a much older man (I was an 18 y/o girl) preying on vulnerable women. He offered to PM me and abused that. He first emotionally distanced me from my friends in the real world so I only relied on him for support. This is how he was able to make me codependent on him and would put up with other things so he could get what he wanted. 

He convinced me I had a serious mental illness so I questioned my sanity so when he made stepped over a boundary I was just being “crazy”. He worked for the NCA. He told me he could “find me easily”. He got my personal details. I was terrified one day he would turn up at my house. 

A couple of other things happened, I eventually went to his work and had to give a statement. I’m pretty sure he lost his job for talking to me at work and abusing his power to manipulate a mentally ill teenager. I had to sit in a room with a bunch of two way mirrors and hidden cameras and talk about everything. They screened my laptop. I don’t know if my video was used in court I kind of left it all behind after that. 

But anyway. All this came from one PM. You should never trust a random stranger not everyone is just looking out for you and wants to talk."
"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.

I'm mostly looking for people I can feel more connected to, for whom I can feel true empathy. And if I could make friends that would be very nice but I know that's not easy.

I don't know about the others but the whole 'relationship with the institution' thing is a huge part of the reason I personally don't like help lines. It's like we're supposed to talk to NPCs. Just like therapists (who I see as helpful tools rather than people who care about me. Well at least help lines do their thing for free.

Not trying to question the rules or anything just expressing how I feel about this. I'm pretty sure a lot of people would agree with me (which is also why I'm thankful to this community, I can relate to people, they can relate to me)."

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.

I have been on both sides of this coin. As a ""helper"", I find that I didn't really help the person via a more live chatting or back and forth messaging. Posting a few replies on the person's thread and boosting them up is fine, but you it's just a whole new ballgame to try and be the person's friend/advisor.

As a helpee, I've found myself disappointed as the person (understandably) just seemed like they didn't actually care all that much with their proposal, and even if they did, it's just not what I was seeking (which is not their fault obviously!).

So yeah, in a way it might even worsen things sometimes. I'm all for support, but I think that it's actually best to just keep it on the thread."

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.

This is sort of counterproductive though. Most of the time, help isn't generalized, it's personalized by nature. Not everyone's depression look the same, some advice can trigger anxiety in others while it can be a wake-up call to some.   


Generally a common way of dealing with depression from a CBT perspective is things like training mindfulness and practicing it often. But this is extremely hard for people with diagnoses like ADD, ADHD to get a working routine on, I'm not saying to defend the ""PM you anytime"" but reddit is a horrendously bad forum to help people quickly, often people get replies during a week's period and some form of support group for this type of struggle, not when people are suicidal low, but still depressed enough to make it hinder their lives can be helped if we could setup some form of group chat to remind each other or give ideas of how to deal with certain situations. A lot of times people know what they need to do, but hearing someone else tell them to do it will be of great importance."

There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option.

In the info section it's mentioned that helper can write in comment if their intention is positive, yet for some they are shy to post in public but they want to share their experience so they might opt to PM.

Although i understand that this rules is to prevent consequences, i am just sharing a view so that PMs are not so negatively viewed.

Although again yes, positive PMs might result in getting the OPs hopes up and gullible for bad-intentioned PMs, but i think i just need to share this.

I don't know if the english is too confusing or understandable though.

Anyway cheers for your wholesome effort 👊🏻"

It's amazing to see that volunteerism and sometimes it does help those with depression. But agency/community contact is important. Everyone gets compassion fatigue.

And you get the idea that their rapport building and call quality goes down substantially. 

These are people who have brought people back from the ledge on a 30 minute phonecall, but clearly would barely be able to handle a simple check in with a well known well behaved caller after their shift."

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.","*Let Me Add My Thoughts with this, I've  must confess I didn't  read the whole post* (or the wiki, wanna check it out later, full focused  in it, I'm  kinda busy rn xp, I promise)  *and I will appreciate  greatly all kinds of feedbacks you all would like to give me. Well, with your permission:

I've suffered depression/been depressed since I was around 10 yo until this year's  February (2019).
(Major depressive disorder, severe depression, you name it. The first  condition it's only a raw translation from my native language to English, although it may be different as the actual English name, sorry if I've made a mistake)

I don't  want to offend anyone here or make this condition appear to be worse than it really is, but for me, it was Hell. Perhaps I'm  lacking the proper words to describe it but for me it feels/felt like that.
Around the same age ( I've  started  my toxic relationship with depression) I've  developed anxiety disorder, I'm  still struggling/fighting against that B****.  A nasty combo.

For some reason unknown, even for myself, in some moment in that time I've started to think about both conditions as females, ladies, nothing against them obviously, they are more beautiful than men,  proved they are more intelligent than men and without the ladies we are just savages, love them all. Xp 

Now, as an adult (25 years old, male) I've took a phrase for myself, it says, more or less:

""Depression is nothing more than a sad lady knocking at our door in a rainy night. Let her in and listen carefully what she has to say, but do not let her stay. Once the rain has stopped, say goodbye to her.
Otherwise, she *Will* get into every corner of your house( Inner me, mind, etc), and kicking her out it's hard, painful and takes lots of time, wasting life. You don't  have to be rude, though, learn how to treat her, listening her words and advising her are the best way to help her and yourself. Letting her stay and being rude will start  a war between both of you, a nasty one, and in the beginning, she is always stronger than us. 
Takes years to overpower her and acquire control.
 Listen the echoes inside of you, the voice around you and read the words dedicated to you. It may be someone nice trying to be nice with themselves or he/she could be someone struggling too, trying to make you know that there's others with their own wars, some of em had lost some battles, others had won, but all of em are fighting back, see them and learn from them. A few others have lost the will to fight and this lady took their heart, alongside their last breath. I never forget them, it could have been me.
There's stairs to heaven, highways to hell and the unlimited potential we all have to evolve, let me tell you my secret ;) :you seek outside the reasons, help, strength or anything you think you need to not give up. You NEED to go and look inside, think about  it. We are amazed by the wonders in the space, maybe because we already forget the beauty of the jewels in the deeps of the planet. That's the hint. 
I'm fool and forget to mention another possibility: if the written words were made for your eyes, the voices for your eyes, or the cheers for your heart, it could be a type of people I admire, respect and decided to become one of them in the future: The friends beyond all the fight. Because you'll find a friend in almost every one of them. And they will be one (or both) of two things: and adviser/helper, like masters, to share with you where they did stumble in their path and suggest useful things.
Or your friends, doing the same as the first, and even more, much more.
They've learned to appreciate anything that shines in the darkness after living there for so long that they don't  want anybody to feel the same, and if you let me include myself with them, we will do such things because we like it, and we mean it. 
I am or I am not. Always. I'm always Too much of anything or absolutely nothing,  There's no mid points to me, I pour my soul in every thing I've decide to do, always help to anyone I can, serve the others and do good recklessly. That's one thing or two I believe in.
So, c'mon Bro, grab this hand I didn't had and take the strength I've lacked. Anytime you want, mate. That's why I'm here for.""
                                                                                                         The mind of Sun

That's a little thingy I wrote not so long ago, I've felt it would be nice posting it here,  it's  not the complete thing, it has some holes intentionally, but it's the first 80% of my own writings I've post ever. Hope it doesn't offend anyone, if it do not help you by any means, hopefully don't  hurt anyone either. I like to write, you know, my poison  of choice are poetry and philosophy  (damned poetry 😂),
And if you catch even the tiniest bit of the deep meaning it also have, you already figured it wasn't a cute this half of my life. Lived in the bottom for years, pretended to be fine bc like we all do, I didn't want to worry not even one of my love ones, I was unable to have a treatment with a psychologist or psychoanalyst, and my whole list of sins didn't help much either.
I've even tried to ""end"" myself  (sorry for this) four times.
Obviously, fortunately, unsuccessfully. 
After I've surpassed, the very first day after, for the first time in years, I've  woke up, happy. I don't  remembered the last time it happened. A couple of weeks after I've decided to believe in the things I've mentioned in my poor writing above, among others. And even more in those in the last two lines.
I didn't had anybody to help me. Support me, freaking avoid I've tried those 4 things.
I'm not fully recovered, I believe  this lady never really leave, it's always lurking but nice you won her, it's  more hard for her to regain full control. I've decided to always go beyond if I find myself a limit for anything, return anything good people do or give to me 10x  times better, if it was something bad, I'd return them something 100x better, don't  be cruel, don't lose yourself, do not treat people as bad as they are, treat them as good as you are.

Many people here would probably know what cost me to learn these things too. 
That's why I wanna help and give my full disposition when I've reply something similar.
Regardless I do like to know all kinds people.
Although I don't think of myself like a hero or anything.
I'm trying to save pain to people that haven't reach that point, help the ones there, and for all the people struggling I'm  saying: I'm here for you, if you want. Just say the word.
I don't start a chat, perhaps because I would be acting for my own selfishness at first glance.
It's  the way I respect people's desires. 
Although, I know how hard it is. 


THAT'S IT, I'VE EXTENDED MYSELF QUITE MUCH.
MY APOLOGIES HOMIES.
I ASK YOU ALL TO FORGIVE MY GRAMMAR, I'M NOT A NATIVE ENG SPEAKER, LEARNED IT BY MYSELF, STILL POLISHING IT, I'M DOING MY BEST. 
THE WRITING IT'S OBVIOUSLY PHRASES I'VE READ AND LIKED, MIXED WITH MY OWN THOUGHTS.
I USE THESE QUOTE TO SYNTHESIZE MY OWN THOUGHTS/WRITINGS.
I'm still a bit embarrassed for it.
Let me quote a hero:
""Whenever you suffer pain, keep in mind that it’s nothing to be ashamed of and that it can’t degrade your guiding intelligence, nor keep it from acting rationally and for the common good""

""My relationship to them. That we came into the world for the sake of one another.""
      MARCUS AURELIUS 

You are more than you think, stronger than you feel, loved than you believe and unique than you perceive.
Seek something you like or care about, make it a hobby. And do it relentlessly. 

Things like mindfulness, stoicism, a essay/book of a subject you like, even slightly interested in, are helpful too.  Learn more things, do more things.
Once you realize what's stopping you, bringing you down, you'll gain power over it and it will get weaker and weaker. 
You are far more than you think.
I believe that, soon you'll  do it too.

Regardless the feedback you guys give me, I'm  here.  Keep that in mind.
Why not? ;)

Good vibes homies ✌✌✌😎
I send you all a Bro hug. 
You can.

Edit: I gave some format to this text, I'm on a mobile right now, you know Reddit don't care about formatting and stuff.
2. I'm respecting the rule of no offering pm or smh, this was a last time. It could be helpful too, hard to measure and globalize something too random as the human being. Just saying.
I'll stick to the rule from now on."

I appreciate the intentions may be good, but from previous experiences there are times when the conversation reaches a natural end - but the other person simply won't stop responding. I've had three definite experiences of this in the past where after a few messages back and fourth, I just want to be left alone and continue. I don't want to remain in private contact but there's no polite way of putting this across to the other person. 

Prior to my time on Reddit, there was one particular forum I was a member of who private messaged me for many months. Probably getting on for a year. In the end, I just had to stop replying and inevitably ended up blocking that person when they continued to message me for weeks afterwards - turning quite nasty. 

As my own personal rule, I don't and haven't responded to any private messages for around a year. I don't mean to offend anyone by that but after several 'less than pleasant' experiences and then the expectation to remain in contact thereafter - I've just had to call it a day and say ""*enough's enough*"". I'll stick to responding to comments in the public domain."

Both as someone who on other social media platforms have tried to help others and have tried to rely on people online to help through a tough time.

The crux of the issue I found is, you don’t know who you are helping. You don’t know them well enough to give that deep, personal, supportive advice they may be aching for.
As well as, being a counselor for free, though honorable, can weigh you down when dealing some people who have hours that don’t work for you or have heavier topics than you were planning and needing the help; especially if you don’t know the person well enough to know how being late, busy, or not being able to properly help an incredibly heavy topic is going to be perceived.
As was said, it also makes the receiver of the help very open to manipulation.

My own life has taught me that the best way to help people is to steer them towards counseling and genuine help that can be in their own life for them, or... if you feel the need to and the infinite patience, discipline, and love required, to genuinely change your life to help another person and be a part of their life.

I’m not saying don’t help anyone unless you can do that; but setting boundaries and clearing up expectations are incredibly important with helping!

But as I said, you don’t know who you are helping and they don’t know you.
And if you aren’t trained on how to protect yourself and the other person from that; sometimes helping people online can end up negatively for both parties.
Accusations, things taken personal, personal issues, energy levels, reading a situation properly; hard to do if not impossible over text platforms.

To all the people who have helped me over the years when they could, under different profiles and such, thank you."

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.","Thank you very much, it makes alot of sense."

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.

Unwittingly guilty. Mine came about because an OP asked what had happened to make me suicidal at such a young age (6 yrs old). That was of concern to me as I felt the ""whole truth"" on an open platform might be triggering or too NSFW for a minor. My private message asked the inquire's age up front with the statement I'd not tell all the facts of my story to a minor. They were 14 so ""apologized"" for asking... From my history, NOT my intent to belittle or dismiss any child/young person who might be struggling with similar historical casual agents & stated that. Thereafter, I gave only a brief summary of just the initial harsh facts. 
My end comment was that, honestly there was no way I could ""fix"" whatever they were dealing with, BUT that they had my ear as a safe place to vent.

I am glad I came across it. Just one suggestion, can u please hyperlink some terms like compassion fatigue (maybe with wikipedia article??) and others.....

I was feeling many other things while reading this, but as the current state of things is with me, I am forgetting/losing track of feelings pretty quickly (idk, it may be flooding followed by my mind closing floodgates).... anyways, very nice post 👍👍"
"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.

I'm not speaking just to you, /u/scorpiontank27), but to everyone who's been upvoting this comment.

In addition to what /u/circinia has so wisely pointed out, there's another reason why it's a sign that's something's seriously wrong if you have trouble remembering this rule.  

If you're really thinking about others' experience, then knowing how getting them into a PM conversation is likely to turn out should make a huge impression on you.  If it hasn't, then maybe you need to ask yourself whether you're responding to others here for the right reasons.  Sometimes when ""we want to help"", what it means is that ""we want to feel helpful"".  ""PM me any time"" is an easy way to make ourselves feel helpful, but if you really think about what the other person's experience, it feels completely different."

It's dangerous to take on too much all at once especially if you aren't a professional. We want to help and sometimes we think there's no potential for error if our intentions are good. Do a little good where you can and just help people to understand they aren't worthless and aren't alone. I appreciate the tact of the mods. This made me appreciate Reddit ten fold.

If ""creation"" is making posts and starting discussion and ""contributing"" is replying to posts, then I think we have as much or even more creation as* contribution based on the low number of responses the majority of new posts get. 

I think that part of it is that a lot of posts are actually kind of comments rather than creations.  A surprising number of posts here are title-only, and we're not super-happy about that.  We would like to see people who've reached out for support (and given the community meaningful information to respond to) get more quality responses and we're working on some things to help with that."

If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",Can someone teach me how to play something?

""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.","Yep. 

The worst part is that most people who contact me directly are stupid bs advertisers or someone who’s just lurking and has no clue what depression is. I’ve made sure to report these people more, I don’t want to come of as a dick but they’re obviously breaking the rules."
"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.","It's always difficult (and worrying) when someone gets attached to a resource or individual that just isn't able to provide the right support.  It happens sometimes at my IRL crisis line, most often because they've never had a supportive conversation before they talked to us, so they kind of ""imprint"" on us (we literally call them ""ducklings"").  It can happen for other reasons too, and no mattter how it comes about, the end result is that they are convinced that ""only X can help me"" and also that ""X has what I need"", both of which are almost always untrue.  This happens all too often even when nobody creates unrealistic expectations or makes - or at least implies - impossible promises  - but ""PM me anytime"" does both those things.  

>  There is one guy who suffers from depression n a slew of undiagnosed issues who always private messages me to respond to my issues which really annoys me. It's complicated cause he has personality issues too.

One of the most difficult training issues at my agency is helping new responders set boundaries with people in crisis.  But it's absolutely necessary - maybe more necessary than with people *not* in crisis.  We harm people by *not* disrupting their unrealistic expectations that can never be met.  We also harm people when we try to give them what we simply haven't got.  So sometimes the best harm-reduction option is to say directly ""I'm really sorry, but I can't give you what you're asking me for"".   It can help to offer alternatives when we say that, even if they reject them in the moment."
"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support.

So it's appropriate for people to be wary of offers of help that come this way.

I'm not totally certain if your concern is for people who might want to ask for support in private (which as the post says is always okay although it still carries some risks) or for people who want to offer help in PMs, though...? Again we're glad to clarify anything that doesn't make sense."

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.

Let alone the 3-hour calls that *don't* end well, eh?

It's extremely rare for crisis-line responders to do 12-hours shifts for many reasons including compassion fatigue.  Ours are 4 hours for phone shifts and 5 for online chat.  Double shifts are *strongly* discouraged."

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue.

That's probably also one reason why people who haven't talked to anybody delete their posts.

For the people I've had experience with, I've found that this usually doesn't mean they want to talk indeterminately so much so as finish some topic without being abstract about it.

Now when you offer somebody the option of just chatting, that can be pretty indeterminate. You pretty much *can't* do both that and be an active member of this subreddit. You can, thankfully, be clear what you mean by chatting and that as a peer you have limitations yourself. This could be selection bias in who I can actually develop a rapport with.

Which is totally different from ending a thread by making sure somebody has talked about what they want to. Seriously, just advising anybody reading to clearly use the words 'reply' and 'in this thread' if they mean that, instead of a generic 'continue talking' offer. Even when starting to talk to somebody on the community threads, it might be best to specify that you're here to chat about this, rather than a generic 'to chat', now that I think about it.

I don't start PM's. I avoid accidentally encouraging PM's. I do reply to them. As far as I understand, this is within the rules since it's not a first resort."

""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.","If I have broken the rule on asking people on this sub to PM me, which I probably have, I apologize."

""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.","How do I link the thread or link you to the messages exchanged?

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.","On mobile, it's under ""community info"", ""about this community"", or a similarly-phrased link, depending on which mobile interface/app you're using."

After suffering for many years with pretty strong clinical depression and talking tons of folks who offer support, it's been rare that I come across someone who tries to abuse you like the OP says. Instead it's common to find those who only offer to listen and/or say cliche phrases to make themselves feel better for their ""altruism"". Their listening can give me an insincere vibe because they sometimes don't say something that would indicate they actually heard what you were talking about. Has irked me considerably."

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.","Yikes, that's awful :-("

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",">I'm saying that seeing how support can work is a viable treatment for every mental-health issue

And i'm saying this is not true. OCD, and a lot of different types of neuropsychiatric disorders usually turns ""support"" from uneducated personnel, into support for destructive behaviors.  


If I'm too be honest, we're not going to help even a minority of people reaching out here, and especially not the majority of suicidal people who just lurk and never reach out or post at all.   


I do agree with you that advice won't help, but I don't agree that support does."
"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.","> And I dont believe in anything, least of all any goodness in humanity. But do you believe any of that?

Personally, I think that humans defy generalisation.  I don't think that people are basically good or bad.  I think we differ greatly under the surface.  

There are plenty of psychopaths that basically have a predatory relationship with the rest of their own species, and only the least-successful of them end up in the penal system.  

There are also plenty of people who will find a way to be decent and kind and useful, and to make the world a better place, no matter how badly the world has treated them.

But I think most people are somewhere in between, and whether they end up being a net negative or a net positive in the world depends on their experience.  And, right now, in the ""developed"" world, I don't think most of us have done a particularly good job at building a society that brings out the best in most of its citizens.  

>  I'm the most negative person alot of people have ever met.

Are you truly ""negative""?  Or do you just need to have your personal ugly truths heard and understood?"

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.

Sure, if the person is suffering from say a mix of diagnoses and is getting support from reddit for depression for his/hers self described situation, that can very easily turn badly if the patient in question is actually suffering from different types of mental health disorders and is currently self harming, that support can turn into support for those destructive tendencies.

It's more an issue of discretion...

I can write, in EXPLICIT detail about the events of my past AND my present. Further, from my own experience, I'm fully aware that some minors unfortunately go through vile & reprehensible things. For this LATTER cause, knowing there's NO age filter on this platform, I won't give ALL of the salacious details of the abuse which led to my suicidal ideations prior to age 6. So, my private message stated as such & I asked the age of the enquirer. (14 yrs old). I then informed them because of that,  I'd give some of the details, but not all of them. Then I stated I remembered well from my experience how difficult the teen years are & that I couldn't fix anything or advise, however if they wanted a safe place to vent, they had my ear.

As a moderator are you counseling I openly speak of the sexual use & abuse which fostered my want of self destruction regardless of the possible (likely) presence of minors?"

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.

Absolutely yes.  

First, that type of content is common here and we don't ask OPs in need of support to censor themselves.  Second, most of the minors who come here have experienced a fairly comparable level of trauma."

Yes, which was my point.

> Nor how you're claiming it would be ameliorated by private conversation with untrained peers where there's no community scrutiny. 

Oh I don't. I think they're equal in their possibility to affect badly. But PMs probably open a different sets of difficulty from bad actors as well as depressed people generally having a bad effect on each other."

My country just signed me up for four more years of orange-flavored authoritarian hell, my job can't pay for my life anymore, I won't get to live without my mom until she's dead (and for the record, I do not want her to be dead, but I will never financially afford boundaries), the car I got two weeks ago already needs multiple thousands of dollars' worth of repairs, and I'm almost at the point where I regret having formed meaningful relationships because I have to stay alive for all of them. They all deserve so much better than me, but the connections are already there--so even though I do think they would be better off in the long run not having to deal with a parasite like me, I don't want to put them through the trauma of being left behind.  
  
I feel like I'm not suited for life. I'm tired of hearing ""you just have to get started"" and ""you just have to apply yourself"" and ""you can do it if you put your mind to it""... I hate to break it to all the people telling me that, but I am now 33 years old. I got started a long time ago, and now I have no self left to apply, and my mind is too tired to be put to anything except sleep. I got diagnosed with ADHD at 31 and can't be medicated because the meds raised my blood pressure too high, which was also probably my fault for being so out-of-shape, and that first week on meds was the last time I ever felt a sense of hope in my life. Every time I see an adult talking about what it's like to have ADHD, I see/hear so many people saying ""just get it together and do what you gotta do"" buddy I am TRYING. And I am TIRED.

I imagine myself standing on a timeline of life, looking behind me and seeing the vast expanse of 33 years lived... looking ahead and seeing potentially 33 more just makes me feel so much dread. There's so much that I want to do, and I'll be able to do none of it, because every scrap of energy I have will be spent trying to dig myself out of poverty and trying to keep the bed cleared-off enough to sleep on. I had a good childhood, and decent eras of life, and it feels like all that is over now. Everything ahead just looks shitty and exhausting, and my already-out-of-shape body will only get less and less able to drag this dumb brain through it all.

Anyone who's lived this long, or longer, especially as a neurodivergent... man, we *out here*, huh?

(Right before I posted this, my cat tried to get on the back of my chair, but missed and clawed the *shit* out of my back instead! Thanks, buddy, you've been *helpful.*)"

Edit: Doctor was very understanding of my situation and agreed it sounds like I've slipped back into depression.

none of these thoughts or ideas are about elimination or anything like that. just things i almost need to type out. and i searched reddit but found nothing yet that seems to fit what i want to do. i found a few reddits that are good and deal with things i like.

I've been looking for a job for the past three months after completing my masters and despite having decent qualifications I haven't received a single reply. I'm stuck in an expensive apartment after I was forced to leave my old place and my savings are constantly dwindling. I'm constantly sending off applications only to receive nothing but silence. I don't feel like anyone is even reading them and it's making me feel so hopeless and ashamed. I entered this field because I loved it, but now I'm wondering if it was a good choice at all. I have a girlfriend I'm crazy in love with, but I have this huge fear in the back of my mind that she thinks less of me because of this situation. Her goals in life are the kind that require a decently high income and I'm so stressed about not being able to be that kind of partner. It's not lost on me that she could easily find someone better who can provide that lifestyle much more easily. I feel so much shame and fear because of this.

I just don't know how to handle this situation and it's absolutely wrecking me emotionally. If I think about it too long I immediately start to cry, I just don't know what to do. It feels like I've done everything I'm supposed to in life - got good grades, excelled at work, did a graduate degree -  and somehow I've reached a complete dead end. I need to get out of this fast and I don't know how. I just can't see the way out of this right now. I'm so tired and my head feels so heavy and I feel like there's no hope anywhere on the horizon."

got back onto my bed, next to my brother and his familys weenie and came onto reddit. reading posts on the feed thing i have and a few responses i made and some weird issues with reddit has me nearly in tears now.

most of what i responded to/with was fun or funny. 2 of the reddit issues are, most reddits delete my responses and the posts i just click the thumbs up button doesnt stay clicked on when i go read a post.

i think some of my sadness is a response i made on a post. it reminded me that i left my so called life, friends and other family.

now my cell phone is acting strange again, got back to having the word change thing not changing every word. but the words (WordPress) arent any i knew existed or used and capital words very rarely used but all the replacements are capital.

now my left thumb left pointy finger are kind of sore especially when i close them and inside/right side of my left arm is similar to my thumb and finger.

please feel better soon me today hasnt even started yet..."

its 9am on a tuesday. the weather is getting colder and there has been less rain so far this year. now what am i talking about?

i have a doctors appointment next week that might direct me to figure out what is going on in my skull. hoping to at least accept my thoughts and make them more comfortable to live with.

currently maybe started about a month ago. i have been getting these ideas/thoughts like dejavoo. even coming to this reddit and this response i feel or know i made this response. i looked it up first and im not seeing it so this must be the only time im making this response.

these thoughts have mostly been online. through an old cellphone not a computer, i cant afford the pieces to build one. i go to a forum or a reddit and i know ive been on it and typed posts or responses but the truth is in front of me. i cant sign into an account or in reddit i cant even like a post someone else makes on reddits because kharma or something isnt enough in my account, however that gets checked... but that idea is strong in my brain.

there has been some real life thoughts i have had that doesnt even make sense to me. like a conversation i feel strongly i had face to face with someone i used to be friends with. The not making sense part is:   this guy that was once my friend (30+ years ago) in high school i barely have memories of him from when we were friends. Yet not only do i remember his full name, i have always had problems recalling peoples names including immediate family, but the conversation we had is a vivid memory in my skull. I dont know or care if he is still alive and luckily i dont use websites or apps that you can try to look up people on. I also was forced lo leave my home state (stupid dumb me) so if he is alive in that state how did we have this conversation? But that idea is still in my skull.

I have had another thought. I came onto reddit maybe 5-7 years ago and maybe thats when i made these replies or comments. Nope i tried signing in under my normal screen name i have used on nearly every website and video game for 30+ years, and the name is in use by someone else for longer than i think i made these fake comments in my brain.

And what is going on with this kharma crap on a lot of reddits? There are a few ive tried to participate in but i cant because spammers and hackers are destroying reddit and my kharma isnt high enough. I guess deleting posts and comments isnt easy to do. But banning people from joining is easy. If i can find a reddit that has no restrictions and ask there how to get kharma maybe i will get the help i need..."

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses.

I'm certain the drugs are making a difference but I've gone from almost deliriously happy about something that happened during therapy (something to give me some hope actually), right to *""I'll finish this lovely meal which I've especially treated myself to and then throw myself into traffic!""* in roughly an hour (spoiler, I didn't throw myself into traffic partly since I was on my way to an appointment with a psychiatrist precisely because when I'm rational I don't want to kill myself and I know this can get better). 

I've been referred for both an autism and ADHD assessment ... I've always self identified as on the spectrum but I never considered myself to have ADHD ... until I read what ADHD is like and it was tick-tick-tick. Given the state of my mind, I don't really care about what the label is though, but I need to understand what the hell is happening to me. I wish the Dr's luck with that though given they will have to sort out what is trauma related and what is down to neurodivergence.

Sleep is still terrible - I'm not sure when I last dreamed something and I'm usually getting 3-4 hours a night and then laying there **wishing my brain would just shut the \*\*\*\* up and stop torturing me**! That's if I'm not bursting into tears for no reason. I'm a 50+ year old man and it's embarrassing to be out on a run and have tears streaming down my face.

I've not got anxiety though ... seriously anxiety can go f\*\*\* itself."

Seriously the combination of the two factors is pretty terrible since it's leaking out of my subconscious in ... strange ways; but at the same time I'm definitely not depressed at the moment.

I had a psych who prescribed a lethal drug (very narrow therapeutic range) to me when I had openly expressed ideation and tendency towards overdoses.


When I did eventually overdose on it (and nearly died) she tried to ghost me. I cornered her into an appointment after a long time and she proceeded to yell at me for lying to her (because apparently I made a promise) and ruining her career. It was all about her.

Personally, it’s much more affirming for a therapist or psychiatrist to ask me to tell them if I’m suicidal rather than sign an inane contract with zero meaning behind it.

What do you stand for? Will you hold your word…type of agreement. It’s simple and straightforward but it also puts responsibility on you. Will you hold on like you said you would when you signed that paper? Did you mean what you said? How much integrity do you have to do what is right even when no one else is around. 

I think we all have it in us… it’s just whether we’re willing to listen to that or not…"
My psychiatrist made me sign a suicide contract,"If his only method to stop me from ending my life is just a stupid piece of paper that I can completely fucking ignore, then I think I’m done with treatment.",The primary reason they have you sign that contract is because it helps remove legal responsibility/liability if you decide to outie 3 thousand yourself after you leave their care

How has nobody come to understand that we'd all be feeling awesome if we could choose that?! I've dealt with some stupid psychologists, but this really takes the cake. Then reading the comments and seeing that this isn't a one-off blunder, but something that has somehow gained traction in therapy?!

Seriously one of the only times I think my anger would override my apathy, and I'd tear the contract in front of them, call them out on how pointless a piece of paper is for something that, if I go through with, renders any and all obligations null and void, and leave.

I am so sorry they did that to you, OP. You deserve a therapist willing to hear out your darkest thoughts instead of shun them, it's okay to feel, and you're allowed to be sad. I know moments like these bring feelings of ostracization and a greater sense of being alone, but there are others who understand."

After months of me telling the therapist everything including the thought of suicide I just gave up it was absolutely a money grab and I begged for depression medication but none offered so I guess maybe I am just not lucky enough to find a decent therapist and this one was the only therapist who returned my call for an appointment out of 20 places called either not accepting new patients or just no return call

Life is not for everyone,"You wake up one day, you feel great for being 63, and you get ready to go to the gym. Your normal routine, you have a good idea of how the day will go. You put on your pants, your watch and you grab your phone to start your day. Except when you leave your house and kiss your wife goodbye for the day, you don't know that you'll get t-boned by a drunk driver at 6:04 in the morning and never return for your family to see you again.

You're 20. You're working construction to manage to pay for your college. You don't make great money, but you're managing. You've got goals, ambitions and a dream. You've got a fiancé, with a baby girl on the way. You're happy. You're becoming a great young adult. You've just got a great job promotion, you're now operating heavy machinery. One day at work, you're needed to perform a digging operation. Coordinates got mixed up, and you hit a gas line pipe and were the only killed on the jobsite. Your fiancé is left devastated, but must grow on.

A newborn baby, seeing its first light, taking its first breaths. Unable to hear your mothers voice, but can feel her presence. You have no idea of what's to come. Everyone arounds you knows it'll be great. But it isn't. You don't last very long on this earth. You die of natural causes, that no one could have stopped. You will be missed greatly.

You're 42. You've worked your entire adulthood. You're alone, with no family and no wife or kids. You always dreamed of doing more, but you're stuck. Mentally, you beat yourself down. And physically, you don't take the actions to make your life better. You want to die. So one day, you pull the trigger. Literally. No one missed you, except your boss, because you were the best in your department. But you never talked to anyone. You never liked anyone. Those people were never your friends. So no one knew you were gone.

There is so many people who die of unplanned reasons every day. There are people who plan out there life. There are people who know that there is something after life for them to look forwards to. Whatever it is, there is no way to stop someone from dying. There's no way to stop someone from wanting to die. Because life is not meant for everyone. Some people know from day one, that the rat race, the fake smiles, the endless torture... will never end, unless you end it yourself. Sure, you could go about it being delusional and ignore everyone around you. How long does that last? We are a community species.

sorry, this is my first reddit post. I didn't put much thought into it, ive never written creatively like this or publicly before... i just wanted to vent my frustrations to the world i guess.

Does depression affect your memory?,"Gonna keep this short

I started therapy because my parents forced me to about two months ago. Lets just say it was because of an event that happened when i was 11, i'm 17 now. It wasn't that traumatic but i can't remember shit. In fact, I'm having trouble remembering a lot of things, and my memory used to be flourishing, and so was my brain, but now its so foggy. My therapist and my mom basically attacked me saying ""C'MON YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER SOMETHING"" but... i just don't know why its so hard for me.

I've been diagnosed with severe depression and ADHD in the past. Although I've been told by some people that I show onset symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar (my mom and grandma had those), i don't think i have them. Anyways, yeah does this stupid illness cause memory defects?",Yes and it causes attention deficits and confusion as well .

Many people with depression (such as myself) experience issues with concentration, focus, and recalling memories. I call it ""brain fog."" This happens because depression impacts certain parts of the brain that are critical for remembering memories and handling our attention and decision-making.


Depression can make it harder to keep certain new memories, so you might struggle to retain information or feel like you're constantly forgetting things. It can also affect working memory (short term) and make retrieving older memories more challenging. 


Sometimes trauma can block out previous memories so it stops hurting you too, I've had that a few times. It can vary from person to person but it can affect memory and cause memory loss, short and long term"

That said, when I really started suffering from it at 13, and anxiety as well, it was so strangely severe I feel as if there was something wrong with me beyond the known depressive symptom.

And I had severe anxiety too, and that made whatever was wrong in my head far worse. 

So for ME, I think that while my depression affected my memory, clear thinking and concentration, I also think something went wrong in my brain beyond that illness, if that makes sense.

I was a smart kid who right when I was accepted into a really good, competitive school, it was like it felt that they made a mistake, my dysfunction so severe it was addressed to me directly. I had locker searches to see if I had drugs, teachers would tell me to go see a doctor, I was that messed up.

If I went to a doctor tomorrow and he diagnosed me with a huge brain tumor, I'd go, ""Oh, okay, so THAT's my deal."""

",I have no energy to cry im just so exhausted from the everyday bs. trying so hard just to survive its sickens me. I never thought as an adult i would be living the life i am now. Ive lost so many family members first real important one was my brother to suicide way back in the 80s then a sister to an illness .losing someone to suicide is no joke! It tares you up for years. Then losing a sister to an aweful desease.then not long after that my Mom.followed by that i started losing the family from my hubbys side it seemed like one after the other.people who were importsnt to me then finally my hubby and the best friends inbetween sorry i suffered so many losses i cant keep up! For me i suffered 2 major heart attacks due to stress and smoking no matter how hard i try to get ahead every year just gets harder and harder to survive..this is for everyone no matter how hard shit gets i never change im still kind to people bc you never know what that persons going through ..i never share what ive gone through only bc i just try not to let it get to me . What i do is let the other person talk and let it out it so they can feel better and i dont have to feel alone. I truly dont like the winter months its so damn depressing and the days get shorter and cold just having alot of issues with no financial support really really sucks! Alot of comments ive read are very relatable just letting you know your not alone in this.and to make it even worse is today is my sons bday and i cant get him a damn thing cause i am so damn broke i just cant stand it ..I shared this in hopes that anyone out there can feel better as well as myself. Thank you for sharing your comments but please remember its not worth hurting yourself as well as leaving behind a broken soul like myself!

I wasn't able to cry for years but a few months ago, I cried. It wasn't much, just 2-3 teardrops flowing out of my eye and not being able to breathe through my nose. But it didn't feel as relieving as I thought it would, everything was the same but now my eyes are in pain and can't see properly, my nose can't breath and has a funky feeling and my throat has some kind of sour feeling and it burns as if I've got acid stuck there.

I have distanced myself from people and stopped trying to foster relationships as I used to.

I lost a few good friends and gosh it is tiring to develop new close ones. I'm tired.

My financial health is not great and I feel bad going out because it would all go to my credit card.

I agree with the other commenter to start small. I joined a gym recently and it really has helped with my mood and self-esteem. The people that go there are very kind, and although our interactions aren't deep, it's a connection that brings positivity. The act of exercising has a wealth of benefits for emotional health and physical well being, which ultimately contributes to your mental well being.

Find something you are interested in and social connections will form slowly. =\]"

If you are not feeling in touch with your emotional and physical self. It’s really hard to connect with others and form bonds. 

I think people feel comfortable and drawn to people who feel comfortable with themselves. And it’s not about having a list of impressive qualities or being able to entertain someone.

It’s just being vulnerable enough to be your own kind of weird and own it. I think that attracts your kind of people.

So maybe start there. Start being back in touch with your own emotions and physical self."

I don’t want to exist anymore ,"I used to be pretty suicidial. I was 12 or 13 years old when I thought so. I used to think I was a burden on my mother and father, and I was a lonely kid, who didn't understand why she couldn't make any friends, or why she never seemed to be happy at all. 

I used to want to kill myself, take pills, hang myself, I wrote letters pretty often and cried a lot. It was pretty painful, I don't remember my teenage years ever going a long time without feeling this way, and let's just say I am left with bad memories of my youth.

But I'm 20 now. I'm old enough. I haven't felt this suicidal in about two years, nor have I thought about my existence this much in so long.

I just don't want to exist. 

I want my name to be forgotten. I used to skip picture day on purpose just so my classmates would ever forget I ever existed. If they saw my name in the yearbook, but no picture, they would struggle to remember what I looked like. I think I'm going down that spiral again. I don't want my father to be worried about money, his retirement, or helping me with school. 

If I had never been born, then I wouldn't have to suffer feeling this way. Maybe it's selfish to want to not suffer, then so be it. I have been selfish for a long time. ","There's a distinction between suicidal thoughts and what you say sounds like ""derealization thoughts"" - not particularly wanting to die, but to stop existing. Yes, there is difference."

","First off, it’s important to recognise that there’s a big difference between passive and active suicidal thoughts. Passive thoughts mean you might wish you didn’t exist or think about dying, but you don’t have a plan or intention to act on it. Active suicidal thoughts involve having a plan and the means to go through with it. Take a moment to reflect and figure out which of these you’re dealing with—it’s a crucial first step in understanding where you’re at.

From what you’ve described, it sounds like you’re really struggling, and that’s valid. You’re carrying a lot of emotional weight, and you deserve support to help lighten that load. The best thing you can do right now is book a doctor’s appointment. Tell them exactly how you’re feeling—be honest, even if it’s hard. They’re there to help you. You might benefit from medication, therapy, or a combination of both, but getting professional help is key.

Clinical depression and suicidal thoughts don’t typically resolve on their own. These feelings can come in waves, but they’re often a sign that there’s something deeper going on. Addressing it now, before things get worse, is a powerful step toward feeling better. You’re not alone in this, and it’s okay to ask for help."

Before trying anything I would like to hear your thoughts and feedbacks regarding anti depression and how it affected you.,If you're talking about the most common antidepressants prescribed like SSRIS and Wellbutrin then I would say they aren't that effective because I have tried both SSRIS and Wellbutrin and neither of them worked for my depression so I would personally say that they're not that effective for chronic depression that you've had for a long time like me. I think Tricyclics or MAOIS would work better for chronic treatment resistant depression. I'm not saying that you shouldn't try it because it might work for you but for me unfortunately they didn't. I would really like to try an MAOI but no pshyciatrist wants to prescribe it.

Before trying anything I would like to hear your thoughts and feedbacks regarding anti depression and how it affected you.,"Like most medication focusing on mental health, it varies with each person. Many doctors that prescribe you anti depressants will tell you that there is a chance of an increase in suicidal thoughts. A small chance, but some people can experience that. The people in the comments telling you its ""poison"" or that it flat out doesnt work are wrong. They are prescribed for a reason, because they work. They wont cure your depression, but the use for anti-depressants is to keep you alive and keep the thoughts that will kill you away. Its always worth trying them and if they dont work then try other kinds. They can take up to a month, before you even notice the effects sometimes, so you do have to be a little patient. Just the thought of having something that can help me, helps me as well."

I think at first you need to think about what happiness in yourself would even feel like?

I say this because in my own personal experience, I was extremely depressed internally for years, finally got through it and now I’m stable, but moving and maybe this is what happiness is?

External sources of happiness tend to give high of highs very quick. Internal takes a while and will feel different than the dopamine a good team win can give. So basically try to get an understanding of what internal happiness is to you and go from there"

It's just that some depressed people are awfully good at masking their true moods. The society demands it, or they're ostracized. 

At least 5% of the world population has experienced depression at one time or another. It's higher in some communities. 

The larger your social circle is, higher the chance you may come across depressives. But many of them also isolate themselves to various degrees (as you too may know) that they become almost invisible."

Would it be more worthwhile to just die
I’m tired of people treating my depression as a “thought”,"I understand some people genuinely have strong and negative emotions/perspectives when they’re depressed. They’re sad and blue and that’s completely valid. But I’m NOT and I wish my family and friends would understand that. My depression doesn’t stem from emotion per se, it’s more related to my traumatic upbringing and life experiences. Sure, emotions definitely were involved but if I’m truly honest I’ve made peace with the bad events that have unfolded in my life. I accept that they happened and stopped asking “why me?”. I understand not all the people that hurt me did it with malicious intent (some did but whatevs) and I forgive them. I’m still extremely depressed. The only reason I can get through the day is because of the fuckton of pills I take daily. I hate the side effects they bring but the other option would just be to rot in my bed until the end. Every single action I do requires an insane amount of energy. I don’t really take care of myself during the weekends as I don’t have to be around people and it’s too much effort. My brain, my fucking neurotransmitters and my neurons are fried from enduring trauma. It’s a physiological issue at this point. If I happen to have any negative emotions they’re associated with how bad and tired I feel physically. This is what happens when society trivializes mental illness. People think it’s about willpower, it’s about perspective and thought. No, depression is literally physiologically in the body as are other conditions like asthma and diabetes. I wish I could just shut them all up or get it through their thick heads once and for all. ","Depression isn’t a “thought” in the way that you’re mind is actively choosing to entertain it 
It’s more of a blanket that hangs over you and encompasses your will to do stuff and participate in society. 

If I had a Time Machine yeah I’d love to go back to teenage me and promote a more positive mental fortitude and try to work though the things that plagued me, but as an adult that has had depression for well over a decade you just hopefully get used to the punches. It’s not as easy as **chin up sport tons of people have it worse than you, you should up and decide to not be depressed** 

Like, thanks for your input lol I wish I didn’t wake up in an existential dread of being alive with the weight of all my failures and problems looming over me. Some days I barely feel the waves hit my shore, other days it’s a hurricane and I’m just doing the best I can do batten down the hatches and make it though the day 

Sorry for ranting, I resonate a lot with your post and wanted to share my experience. Specifically when you mention how every action takes so much energy because that’s so fucking true. How am I expected to do more than just exist if actively doing that basic task takes upwards of 90-100% of my energy and will. I didn’t ask to be here, I didn’t sign up for this Sisifician endeavor

I hope some good vibes come your way internet stranger, you are not alone on your quest for a better tomorrow. Keep fighting the good fight"
Insomnia insomnia insomnia,"I don't sleep. It's like 5 in the morning. I've been awake since 6pm. I don't usually fall asleep anymore until maybe like 10am. Then sleep until 4 or 6pm. And I'm always exhausted when I wake up, but then once it's night I can't fall asleep. And on the rare chance I do fall asleep, it takes anywhere form 1-2 hours of me laying in bed with my thoughts in pitch black before I sleep. And trying to sleep druing the day takes forever, too. 

And I never sleep good. It's always a light sleep that's easily disturbed. I don't often dream, and when I do, it's usually nightmares. Sometimes not. But most of the time. 

It's so draining. No energy. Lethargic all the time. And it, of course, isn't helping my depression much. No energy for anything. Though it dosent seem to have triggered a depressive episode. Not yet atleast","I went through this, too. Even now, when I take medications, I still have moments when I can't fall asleep. I feel drowsy and tired, my eyes are closing…but I just can't fall asleep. The last time it happened, I couldn't fall asleep for 4 days, and it was so scary. I remember crying and praying to fall asleep because of how exhausted I was…It’s draining, I know.
But please, know you’re not alone in this. I see you, and I understand. You’re doing the best you can, even if it doesn’t feel like enough. Keep holding on."

I’m so lost I don’t know what I want. I workout. I have an okay life I should be grateful but I can’t help these thoughts and I can’t help feeling so shit about myself. I want a do-over in life. 
I hope you get through this too I know it’s tough but just take one day at a time"
Success stories,Are there any success stories of people who got better?,"At 24 I was 100 pounds, using drugs and selling daily, was on the brink of ending it and instead I joined the military. I didn't expect to make it, but I was desperate. Not only did I make it, but I actually excelled in some aspects. I did things I never did before, and I was good at it. It was a great boost of confidence. Plus the days were so long and exhausting, I slept better then I had in years. I felt good for the first time in years. I'm still in, and sometimes I still struggle, but my job keeps me busy which helps. Change of lifestyle, scenery, and staying as busy as I can works better than any meds or therapy for me. However, it is different for everyone. For some meds work, others therapy, so on and so on. But physical activity, staying busy, and doing something new (it's terrifying) but oh so rewarding. Hope to hear your success story someday!"
Success stories,Are there any success stories of people who got better?,"Thanks for your story!  I’ve been suffering from depression this time around for almost two years. I wake up very early every morning and unable to fall back asleep.  I know this will pass, but I wish it was sooner."
Success stories,Are there any success stories of people who got better?,"It definitely fluctuates. I swear, I've been on the floor in the dark, thinking I was going to die. 7 years later, it's a distant bad memories. You'll have good and bad days, and sometimes it takes a long time trying different treatments to find what works for you. But I always encourage people to try absolutely everything before ending it. Even if it means selling you possessions, fleeing the country and backpacking somewhere working odd jobs. Something drastic you know? If you're gonna die anyway, might as well. You never know what life can bring. I understand everyone is different, and for some, it's far more debilitating then even I was, but I would still ask them to try. I hope you find your thing that works, don't give up! Don't give this shitty world the satisfaction!"
Turning my life around.,"I had nearly attempted Friday and planned to attempt on Monday. After venting and letting all my feelings out I realised that maybe, perhaps there is still a glimpse of hope. I have a choice and I choose life. I give life one last try. Im going to start exercising, going to therapy, being more productive and fight this mental illness as hard as I can.

I thank all of you who have helped me in this journey to turn my life around. I am forever grateful 💜.",Hi friend. I’m glad you are putting in the effort to better your life. It’s not easy but it’s the work we put in that gives us hope for the future. Love you.

I just wanted to give a suggestion to take your own time to complete your goals because we try to do it all at once so the bad feelings also come back all at once. My therapist also mentioned to set small targets in a day and try to complete them so that it's not overwhelming. It helped me.... I hope this helps you too.... You are really incredible for trying to get better.

I'm a terrible son, brother, and person overall. So the very least I could do is write my book. To at least prove to the world that I was here, even if one person reads a single page, it's proof I was here. ","you are not that terrible person you think you are, & that’s coming from someone who should be at the top of the list. 26 is still pretty young, it’s totally okay to be all of those things you listed at that age yet. my sister just got into her first relationship at 24. im 25 and had to ask my mom to borrow me money JUST yesterday because life is hard & expensive. my coworker, who’s 36, is homeless + carless due to a mix of life choices, mental health, & no support system, and i think she only still works to have something to do. it honestly amazes me, as someone who suffers from depression too, idk how she does it. (ETA: this detail is not to seem like “someone has it worse off”, it’s to add another perception of someone who also doesn’t have much and feels behind/like a loser, she is a truly wonderful person but i get why she feels that way) anyways, that’s all just to point out some similar & relevant details of other people’s lives that i know personally. if you looked at any of their/my social medias, you’d never find any of those details public. many feel behind yet no one even has it all figured out on how to live the perfect life and timeline. ya know? 

i’m not trying to change your mind or view, but at least know that: none of that makes you a loser or terrible person, etc. it makes you human, like many, many of us are experiencing currently as well. 

maybe wait until you’re 36, 32, even 30? just a thought. i unfortunately do still understand regardless & i wish you well, friend"

"It’s me again, burden girl","Hi, this is my second time writing here, but I wanna share my feelings in more detail. I started feeling depressed when I was 11 years old, and now I have 4 months left until I turn 19. The reason for my depression is my parent’s’ divorce, which happened when I was 6 years old. I cant forget the day I woke up terrified because my brother and sister were crying because my mom was about to leave and we all bagged her to stay but… she left without saying goodbye or looking at us. After that day, we frequently went to family court, the problems between my parents and my mom left made me feel like a burden to everyone.

I spent my childhood and teenage years hating life and struggling to accept that my mother left without caring of us and gave us a true love. Guys, I’m still struggling and no one knows, but I’ve talked to my friend about what happened and wrote everything that hurts me on the paper, but it’s really hard to move on. It gets worse when I see someone being cared by their mother or when I watch a movie about a mother and her/his child. It’s really painful and puts me in a deep sadness and depression.

I can’t go to the therapist because that would  affect my future if my mental health improves. I’m so tired of everything and just wanna leave everything behind. I hate my mother because she wasn’t a good mom. My religion doesn’t allow adoption, or else I would have had a better life with a new family and a new mother who care about me, love me and don’t make me feel like a burden to my family or friends. Leaving this life would probably be the best thing for me, my family and friends :):","You aren’t a burden! Are you sure your mom doesn’t like you? Is it possible you don’t have the full story and there was cheating or abuse? You should know by now how complicated adult relationships are, things happen that you just can’t tell a 6 year old. Hang in there, you can overcome this with your own loving family and friends. ❤️"

I spent my childhood and teenage years hating life and struggling to accept that my mother left without caring of us and gave us a true love. Guys, I’m still struggling and no one knows, but I’ve talked to my friend about what happened and wrote everything that hurts me on the paper, but it’s really hard to move on. It gets worse when I see someone being cared by their mother or when I watch a movie about a mother and her/his child. It’s really painful and puts me in a deep sadness and depression.

I can’t go to the therapist because that would  affect my future if my mental health improves. I’m so tired of everything and just wanna leave everything behind. I hate my mother because she wasn’t a good mom. My religion doesn’t allow adoption, or else I would have had a better life with a new family and a new mother who care about me, love me and don’t make me feel like a burden to my family or friends. Leaving this life would probably be the best thing for me, my family and friends :):","Yes she doesn’t love us she’s didn’t even give us a one minute to take care of us, I mean… all those beautiful moments with her was just a fake"

I HATE MY OWN BLOODLINE,"I HATE MY OWN BLOODLINE  
  
I want to share my story. I’m a 25-year-old man who feels depressed and disconnected from my own bloodline. I’ve never kissed a girl or held her hand, and maybe that’s because I vowed to myself not to marry unless I became filthy rich as I have seen the true meaning of poverty. Or maybe it’s because I feel ugly as hell, and girls see me as a creep. Either way, I’m a porn addict who has never spoken to a girl.  
  
Here's my story:  
  
I come from a wealthy family one that once owned an entire city capable of hosting 20,000 people, complete with farms, shops, and small craftsmen's workshops. We weren't nobles or ruling class, but rather merchants and landlords. My ancestors had it all: wealth, power, and respect.  
  
However, there’s a missing chapter in my family’s history. My great-grandfather, whom we'll refer to as the first letter of his name “G,” was born in 1906 and died around 1960. He squandered the family fortune on nothing but hedonism. He had 43 known children with multiple women, spent all his inheritance on lavish living, and when he met women he liked, he showered them with gifts (mostly gold) just to spend a night with them.  
No one know how ""G"" ended up with all the wealth, altho there was some people who should have the wealth but for some reason they didn't, this guy got everything when he was just 3 or 5.  
  
When he finally passed away, he had depleted most of the family fortune, leaving his many grandchildren to fight over scraps. Each ended up with a small house, a shop, or a tiny farm.  
  
You'd think they would have learned a lesson. You'd imagine they wouldn't have any children they couldn't support. But no.  
My grandfather witnessed the decline and yet had 12 kids, leaving them only with a house and a small shop, Now you might wonder how he got a small shop and a house together? Well inbreeding make wonders. After he passed, his family split what little remained, and they still got almost nothing of the small fortune he accumulated. Did they learn from this? Absolutely not.   
  
My father went on to have nine children, including me. I was born while we were deep in debt, and we had to move to another country when I was three. We had nothing left in our home country but debt, and we still don't have anything here either. Additionally, due to legal issues, I can't work until I pay around $15,000, which keeps increasing yearly (a debt of the result of hospital bills and lawyer fees). The minimum wage here is $475, while transportation alone costs almost $130.  
  
I can’t work officially until I pay off that debt, and the only jobs I can find are side hustles that barely cover my commuting costs. Sometimes, I get lucky and find someone who will let me work for a few months before they cut me loose by asking me to be in their records officially, and I can't do that obviously unless I pay the debt.  
  
I’ve had countless ideas to become wealthy, some of them been scratch because someone else did it first and got rich of it. It makes me question if I’m just unlucky or if I did something wrong in a past life and am paying for it now. Each idea I come up with requires money that I don’t have, and my side hustles aren't enough to get me started. I’ve tried everything: game development, website development, video editing for memes—nothing ever worked. The problem is that I can't do anything outside the realm of PC and internet-related ""jobs"" until I pay off that enormous debt and those PC and internet ""jobs"" are the most disheartening aspect of my life; I feel even more depressed working on a computer than I would doing actual labor.  
  
Sometimes, when I feel lonely, I wonder if that piece of garbage ""G"" ever felt lonely. When I go hungry and can't afford food, I ponder if he ever felt hunger. When I run out of cigarettes and can’t buy a new pack, I think if he ever experienced deprivation. When I become depressed, I question if ""G"" ever felt anything less than happiness. When I feel loneliness and resort to cheap coping methods known as porn, I can't help but wonder if that bastard ever felt lonely.  
  
There’s a reason why 99% of wealthy families can’t keep their wealth beyond three generations. There’s always that one piece of garbage who ruins it for everyone. ""G"" wreaked havoc on his own grandchildren in a way they could never recover from.  
  
So, why am I depressed? It's not just because I’m poor and in debt for reasons beyond my control. It’s the disconnection from this cursed bloodline. None of my relatives think the way I do; most of them are lazy, ignorant, and have nothing in common with me, including my own father. After all, most people who share my last name are descendants of ""G,"" and the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.  
  
This disconnection has become a major issue. I feel increasingly lonely, especially since I have no friends in this life and now feel estranged from my relatives as well. Loneliness is the root of my depression, and I can't seem to fix it because I don’t know how to make friends.  
The only time I ever felt less lonely was a year ago in a coffee shop   
While sitting there, a girl approached me and start making a small talk with me, told me I looked beautiful (even though all girls usually think I’m a creep because of my looks and demeanor). This girl was a solid 7/10—attractive and four years younger than me. After some small talk, she gave me her number. In that moment, my entire childhood flashed before my eyes. What would be the point? If I had a child with her, how would I feed or provide for him? And if we ended up married, how could I afford to rent a home with my meager side hustles? Hell How cloud I give her a gift of I barely pay for my own food!  
  
So, I never called her. I think I’ve associated money with happiness and not being a lonely, miserable person due to my childhood. I place the blame squarely on the shoulders of that single piece of garbage I’ve never met, “G.”  
What’s stopping me from committing suicide isn't the feel of hope, it's the uncertainty of what happens after death. But if reincarnation is real, I will do what ever it takes to find that bastard and torture him to death, then kill myself to find him in the next life.

If there’s a heaven and hell, I’ll do my best to make it to hell just to ensure I can torment him there.  
  
I’m not looking for advice; I just wanted to share my story.",I read your story.
I lost everything ,"I’m 23M, I lost everything. I was in a relationship for 5years+ and she left me about 6months ago. Everything in my life was perfect. I got lucky with a “side-hustle” I had over 200k in my savings account at 19. Thought I was with the girl of my life, bought a small house and everything was doing so good. 

About a year ago, I started feeling something weird in my relationship and I  started to overthink everything. When she told me she wanted to go her own way I was destroyed. 

I started vaping way too much, started doing drugs alone every night and started gambling. I lost everything in gambling, literally everything. I just don’t know what to do anymore I have no one to talk about this cause I’m so so ashamed of myself. I don’t go out much, I work from home et go to school from home too.

I’m seeing a therapist for depression and medication at the same time.

So yeah, I lost everything, I’m alone and completely ashamed of myself. I just don’t know what’s going on in my head.

I want to get better but have no idea where to start I feel like it’s already too late.","You had your heart broken. And instead of feeling the pain you tried to numb it out with drugs and gambling. 

It’s okay. This is what a lot of people do. It’s so uncomfortable and insufferable to just feel the entirety of loosing someone. And loosing the life we had. 

But you turned to the vices and in turn lost more. It’s okay. You are human. We all steer off path and get lost. 

But the beautiful thing is we all can choose to do a little bit better one day at a time. 

I recommend just allowing yourself to feel the loss. Don’t try to distract. Be okay with letting it feel
Bad and find healthy ways to express and heal. 

You’re young. You have so much cool shit ahead of you. Just keep showing up for yourself and choosing to do small acts of good things for you. 

The little steps add up I promise !!!"

IDK what to do anymore..,Im 21m and i’ve been depressed and on and off drugs and alcohol to cope with it.

I just want to sit around or lay in bed and get drunk.

Just needed something to be left behind when im gone i guess is why i wrote this..,">I cant even motivate myself to work

This is considered problem? Working as it is now is worthless social construct.

>My girlfriend tells me i don’t show her empathy when she’s upset

This is tricky one because she may be dramatizing as fuck but you might not see how it really looks and really might not show the empathy you think you are showing due to bad mental health. My ex girlfriend was telling me that I'm not showing interest in her and I thought, that I'm showing a lot of interest because I was genuinely interested in her, but due to my mental problems **my 100%** I thought I give was not enough."

I was in a similar situation (albeit 23) and then packed my bags and moved to Denver (basic as hell) but it was the best thing I ever did with my life. Got me away from a lot of my vices and factors into my depression. 

Takes awhile but embrace change if you can. Gets you out of the cycle

Wish you luck"

Why are people so mean?,"Hey, idk i just need to vent. My whole childhood i've been called fat, on my early teenage years i lost some weight and was called skinny, now (still on my teenage years) my grandma said i looked skinnier before, a stupid lady said my face was very round and i can't take that of my mind. A friend of mine once said i had very thin lips, i've been made fun because of my eyebrows,  i've been called ugly more than one time and among other things that i don't rlly want to talk about. Im so fucking exausthed I lost all my happiness and my will to live and Im so fucking tired of ppl judging me, of ppl making fun of my scars, of ppl judging my appearence, my stupid body is all ruined and deformed i hate myself so much I swear id kill someone to be pretty, to look like any other girl, to be skinny, to be loved. People don't take me seriously when i say sometimes i wish i wasn't here, going to therapy isn't working for me and it honestly even made it a little worse and im so fucking helpless...i don't know what to do anymore i feel so alone and so misunderstood","I for one am not so sure about beauty standards because I honestly don't give a f*** about what people think about me. I have also been through this and the only thing I realised is that no matter how much I change or whatever I do they always have something to say. So I decided that I should just be whoever I want to be. It was difficult at first but as time passed by and as I was being myself it felt as if I was free of the chains and shackles. I just want you to be happy the way you want to be because it's all about what we feel and no it's not selfish,  it's prioritizing ourselves and trying to be the real us. It's selfish of others to ask us to change something about us..... There is no normal or abnormal..... If you think something is normal it is normal... What people say to others is often them projecting their insecurities on others...... I hope this helps."

I keep telling myself that I shouldn't kill myself because I would only hurt the people closest to me, but for the past few years that thought is slowly becoming a thing of the past. The only regret I have in life right now is knowing people and how they would feel if I committed suicide. I want them to hate me and I want to chase them away so when I die, they won't feel so guilty. I wake up just to work, eat and sleep. I don't have any hobbies and I just don't seem interested in them (I tried) I shouldn't even be born, I wish I didn't experience life. ","I feel completely the same, it’s my belief that there is no point no life, no god, and therefore we of course are just highly evolved animals, and therefore the only thing that brings true ‘joy’ I guess is surviving, eating and having sex, now that surviving isn’t difficult (at least in my case living in a first world country) we all have to just find distractions, thats all everything is, YouTube and games and media, pointless shit to distract our highly evolved brains from realising all of this is pointless, I can’t understand all these people happy to work for 50 years just to die before even seeing the pension, I don’t understand how other people can’t see how pointless it all is. I had a normal 9-5 job but it barely paid my rent and bills as it was and I was miserable, so I quit and am just living as minimally as I can until I run out and then I don’t know what I will do. Sorry this isn’t advice or help lol, but your not alone"

What can I do","Go to a hospital and ask for help. Don't think that a note is somehow going to alleviate the pain your family will feel. Talk to them, tell them about your life, the good and bad. Don't let a passing thought destroy all of your beautiful possibility. I hope you know I am proud of you for getting up today, I'm glad you are alive.

How to curb nighttime sadness?,So very often I get sad at night. Usually close to bedtime. I'm not sure exactly why. But apparently this happens to other people too. And I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to curb this feeling? If there were any tricks to keeping myself from feeling this way. Because sometimes it's a bit unbearable. ,Nighttime is hard. Old TV shows are comforting to me. I like to fall asleep with them playing at a low volume. Writing in my journal at night also helps

Anything to get your mind off of things.  All of these things i still do lol.  Im not sure what it is about the night that makes us feel this way."

"My boyfriend is depressed, how do I help him?","I hope here are some people that can help- 
I've never dealt with depression myself. My boyfriend won't leave his bed, he refuses to eat or drink, he won't talk to me, sometimes he doesn't even seem to notice me. He only wants to sleep all day. 
What can I do to help him to feel at least a little bit better? 
Any tip is welcome, thank you","Unfortunately, with these things, at least as someone with depression, your presence and support is really the best thing. But he needs to help himself too. If he takes no steps to seek help, it'll end up making you more unhappy in the long run. Perhaps you could help find him resources, and if it gets really severe, you can perhaps request a mental health team to come out and assess depending on where you live"

What can I do to help him to feel at least a little bit better? 
Any tip is welcome, thank you","Talk to him about hopes and dreams, and tell him to be completely honest about them no matter what. If that doesn't work, talk to him about his deepest and darkest fears and worries about the future.

There's two ways to motivate others to move forward, you can either use the things they want to motivate them, or you can you the things they don't want as motivation. Regardless of whether he's moving forward towards something he wants or moving forwards away from something he doesn't want, he'll be moving forward and will get out of his swampy mindset eventually. 

You should know something about depression: it literally makes you unable to feel positive feelings and emotions, it sucks all the hope out of the future, it makes all the bad things in the past seem worse than they are, it makes you feel like you're a cancerous tumour on the lives of others, that your existence makes everyone around you miserable. It's not a frame of mind that's easy to escape if you're following your heart and feelings, it's something you need to use your head to escape. Coaxing him into thinking about what the next move to make to progress forward in life can be done just by bringing up the subjects I mentioned at the beginning, hopes and dreams, and deepest fears. 

Good luck, and please don't hold it against yourself if nothing you try works. Only people who want to be helped can actually be helped, and sometimes depressed people just want to feel sad for whatever reason."

Do you know how when you get a fever or cold and lose your appetite for eating anything no matter how delicious you would normally find it? 

Depression, in my experience, is like that, except you now no longer have an appetite for being alive. You don't feel positivity, optimism, or happiness at all. Anything that used to make you happy now no longer does. You don't derive pleasure from literally anything. You feel like a burden on your friends and loved ones. You don't want to take care of yourself. You don't want to eat or drink or use the restroom. You don't want to move. Hell, you don't even want to breathe. Every breath you take is a reminder that you are still alive and existing when you'd greatly prefer the opposite. 

Your boyfriend is very fortunate to have someone as caring as you. If I wasn't single... and I was having a bad episode. Personally, I'd just want to be held. No talking. As mentioned by another commenter, your presence and support is the best thing."

Any tip is welcome, thank you",This advice is more for him than you I guess (I don't know what to tell you other than gentle encouragement - too much would have made me feel like shit more when I couldn't get out of bed either) but just celebrate tiny victories one day at a time. I almost can't comprehend how I was in that state anymore but I know it happened. Honestly I think the biggest thing that helped me was just trying to go for a walk every day. Even if literally just down the street and back. I couldn't refute that at least I tried something and over time I built back up to being able to do big things again. I would never have been able to think my way out of it. I had to prove to myself that I could do it and that took time and definitely wasn't linear either.

What can I do to help him to feel at least a little bit better? 
Any tip is welcome, thank you","Take him to see a psychiatrist. If he needs treatment to get better, they will know.

I’m bipolar so I’ve done this a few times. I feel that you need to be hard with him. Make him leave his bed. Make him eat and drink. Make him take a shower and get dressed. Because letting him get it like he wants it and just lie there and wither away in bed, not eating or drinking, is not helping. He’s making you a bystander to his slow demise this way and it’s not a fair position to put you in.

Depression needs positive change. You shouldn’t ask everything from him at once though. Perhaps first you have a talk with him about this. And tell him that you’re willing to be there for him and help him out of this but that he’s got to work with you. He’s got to promise to try to eat and drink at least a little to begin with. 

And then he could start facing the other challenges one by one. But first you need to start engaging with him a lot more. He needs the cognitive work out of having conversations.

Why do I suggest you do things that will bug him? Because I’ve been where he’s at and that is a dead place and what he’s doing in that state of mind is not living. I had my mom bug me. Wouldn’t have survived without her."

I don't exactly know how much depressed he is, but please make sure he is safe. Check on his arms (carefully). Take care of him. And please stay calm and don't panick if he says some things like 'im gonna do something very bad to myself', but don't take this lightly.

What can I do to help him to feel at least a little bit better? 
Any tip is welcome, thank you","As someone who has had a few depressed people in their life and is fighting with depression themself, here are a few things you can do:

1.Be there, but don't be pushy.
Keep spending time with him, keep letting him know that you're there for him, that you care and talk to him. Be patient, be kind.

2.Take care of yourself.
Many people underestimate how draining it is to take care of someone who's depressed to the point, they literally give up on life. Seek counsel for yourself, make sure you don't ruin yourself while you try to help him. Being in this kind of situation can be stressful and scary, but at the end of the day, there is only so much you can do.

3.Take care of him.
He doesn't eat? Make him some food. He doesn't drink? Prepare a glass of water.
Open his windows every now and then, make him get a little bit of sun. When you notice, that he gets a bit more active or responsive, ask him to eat with you at the table, take a walk with him.

4.Help him seek help.
This only works, if he wants the help. No amount of therapy is going to help you unless you want to work on it yourself, but if he agrees to it, make it as easy as possible for him. Look for available therapists or council in your area and make him a list.
Remember: sometimes it's trial and error with your therapist. He might not like the first one he finds, but that's okay, he doesn't have to stick to them. A relationship like that is like any, they go both ways.

It might also help to let someone close to him, like his family/friends know? I don't know, if that's something he'd be okay with, but when my mom was burned out and depressed and didn't leave her bed anymore, my older brother called her friends from another city. They took about 3 weeks of vacation from work, showed up the next day and literally pulled my mom out of bed two days later, took her on walks, went out and took her on a trip a week later. This is a very extreme way of forcing someone out of bed and it might not work for everyone and some people probably get worse from this. It did help her get through it though. She continued to struggle with depression for a few years after her burnout, but she's stable now.

I hope this helps. Best of luck for you and your bf!"

Tomorrow isn't predefined, there's no destiny and it can be whatever you want it to be. 

Even if that's only a lil bit better than today, that's beautiful. 

You have soo much control over that, I totally get way you're saying and I'm sorry you're in this dark place ❤️"

Depression ,"Depression is like the fickle weather. Somedays you feel like you can conquer the world and somedays it is hard for you to even get out of bed.

I see you.

You could put obstacles in place to avoid drinking, how to avoid having a bottle of something at home and when you want to go shopping, think again why you do it and what you gain from it, sometimes it will work and other times it won't, don't try from one day to the next either. not taking more will be very difficult since it is like a habit, reduce it gradually
For example, if you drink 4 bottles a day, try to drink only 2, and then when you get used to it, only 1 
Another would be one day yes and one day no and when it is not difficult for you to go one day without drinking then you can go three days without drinking and so on consecutively. 
It's all about taking small steps and the fact that you try is a victory and even if you fall, try again"

I've been an alcoholic for over 6 years and trust me man, it is worth it to quit and right now in this moment you are in the best possible position to quit 100% for good. Quitting when you're older is much harder and without detoxing at a hospital can kill you. I'm lucky to be even typing this rn tbh. 

So first things first. In order to truly put this shit behind you you have to sit down with yourself and admit to yourself you have a problem and that you need help. Once you accept that mentally the rest can follow. You have to stay fully committed to self control every day no matter what happens or how stressful it gets. I highly recommend AA, or opening up the Bible and trying to find Jesus. Ultimately I didn't quit on my own, God did 80% of the heavy lifting. You can do it, you just gotta start loving yourself and stop blaming yourself for your addiction and start unraveling the threads that got you to the place you're in."

For just alcohol that should be about 5 days and it's more a medical observation to make sure you don't have a seizure. You might get Ativan or something too if you're withdrawing at all.

I can always do some research for you aswell if you'd like some help finding a good one.
Alcohol I need help. ,"I’m 24m. So done with it all man. Drinking everyday for atleast 2 years. Don’t like being drunk. Just a way for me to cope and run from the pain in my life. I ain’t got no parents. No real friends. Nothing man. Fucking sick of waking up everyday with a headache and heart pounding. Only to eat one meal. Drink some water then do it all over again. 

Last night was bad. I got too drunk, opened up to my partner and now things are just so awkward. I need help to stop. I don’t know where to go. I’m lost. I feel like shit.

Alot of the time, rehabs don't have enough beds. So theres often a waiting period anywhere from a week to a month or more. Its pretty poor care alot of the time, but it does the job (getting you off drugs or alcohol safely) 

As far as really staying sober, there isn't much rehab provides someone with other than a safe place to stay away from drugs, Alcoholics anonymous, and possibly some CBT/DBT, therapy groups, etc. But it differs depending on the rehab.

I don't know if its acessible to all but it is accessible to many. You either need insurance or pay for it yourself."

It's like I make it worse,"TW: SH

I felt kinda bad this morning, so I went to have a shower. When I unclothed and saw my scars I got a strong urge to SH. I sharpened my knife and I cut deeper than expected and had a full blown panic attack. I bled on the floor and my clothes. I drank 5 shots of espresso, put on some breakcore, and sat in my bed staring at the wall for 30 mins. Now I feel terrible. I don't have the energy to mask today, so I've had to cancel my only plan this weekend. My hip is hurting. 

I feel like I'm getting addicted to SH. I didn't even feel that bad when I did it, but now I feel terrible. It's like I have a need to be damaged. I clearly don't want to be happy. I hate being alive. The only thing keeping me here is the promise from my therapist that I can get better if I seek psychiatric treatment. I don't feel like I'll ever get better. I don't deserve to get better. I'm a terrible person. Does it get better? Will the urge to ruin myself ever stop?",Do you have someone you could talk to nearby?

Getting old,"What’s the point of living a long life? All I know is everyone dies eventually. I’ll see loved ones pass, and I’ll keep getting dogs or cats until I eventually pass, which will leave them alone without an owner. Also, I can’t justify getting married and having kids. I just can’t bring a child into this mortal coil. I’m in my 30s and honestly can’t take much more of this crap. I love nature, family, and my pets. It’s just not enough to see the light at the end of the tunnel. ",I am 36! I know this feeling. I know that I should enjoy every moment since this time will not come back. Still can't help myself.
Feeling isolated ,"When I drive past people who are living their lives they look like robots or aliens to me. 

How are they able to just walk around and function? How are they able to care about the small things? 

","They don’t overthink because most problems are created in the mind, not in reality. They focus on what’s in front of them, letting the simple joys and tasks of the day carry them forward. It’s not that life is perfect for them, it’s that they don’t let their thoughts turn it into something heavier than it needs to be."

Im very ready to end my life now,I was awake the whole night. I cant do this anymore. Life never stopped fking me up. Im done. Im done fighting or trying to survive. Im done.,I'm willing to talk if you want. I'm very sorry you're going through this.
so down bad im considering turning back to religion/God,"basically the title - I know we’re not supposed to promote religion on here, mostly just wanted to explain my feelings. I’ve never been a very religious person, stopped going to church around high school when I realized i just wasn’t super into it. lately, my depression has absolutely cornered me into an abyss of hopelessness and despair so deep, i am willing to try anything at this point to just make my life bearable. i am considering going to church tomorrow morning for the first time in 10 years. i guess i don’t really know what I’m looking for. maybe if i believe, God will save me. I don’t know. ",There’s nothing wrong with that. Faith helps a lot of people.

I Want To Be Better So Badly,"I feel like an absolute idiot and I know I look stupid too. I know that I say it so many times that if I can just get through this then things will get better then they fuck up again.

I hope somehow I can find a way to pull myself out from this one and make it to some help. Even if it takes begging on the streets to get the opportunity Im finally ready to say that I need help.

Id love to be able to go to a facility that isn't state run because I've been there and it is God awful where I live.

The cost of sucks, the American healthcare system sucks. There are people out there that want to help, truly. But I am an absolute fool and I push them away every time because I'm unhealthy mentally.

I am not owed anything, none of us are, but I am definitely at the point in which I'm ready to relinquish control and get to somewhere that's going to help my mental health and just beg somebody to help me learn how to fix my life and the repercussions I've been suffering from because of the choices I make because I have no real coping skills.

I hope I can just make it through this one more time at least, somehow.",I wonder if I will ever be functional
What’s this all even for?,"Repetition. It’s the repetition of every day and everything being the same while wrestling with the feeling that I think I know nothing will ever get better. It’s not a lack of accomplishment or opportunity. I’ve served in the most difficult branch of the military, work out regularly, and have a masters. I have a career as a mental health therapist (I don’t see hopelessness as universal, just my own battle). I’ve been in and out of mental health hospitals most of my life, go to therapy, been through IOP, PHP. But I can’t help see my life as pointless and it feels so empty. I spend most of my days fighting back the self-harm thoughts, take my many meds, look up lethal doses of the medications I have, and find distractions to just get me to the next day. Truth is, I feel like I know I will die by my own doing one day, it’s just a matter of when. I just want to stop playing this game of life and leave on my own terms. ","That's exactly how I felt, no matter from which point I look at life it always felt pointless because we all die eventually. Then I realised that I was thinking too much..... I was immersed in finding out my purpose in life and always felt there was no point. Now I've stopped searching for the purpose of life because I know we all die in the end, and people say life is beautiful something which I could never relate to. Now I'm living my life instead of just existing I'm living it, by making choices, they may either be good or bad. I am going with the flow by accepting the reality and myself so that in the end when I'm in my deathbed I don't regret the choices which I didn't make.... But be happy even about the bad choices I've made and proud of myself for living my life on my terms and struggling in a world where everyone is struggling to fit in. So I think it's better we live in the present instead of thinking about the end..... There is always a future.... But right now at this moment we should be easy on ourselves. This is just my perspective of life.... I hope you see life in your own way instead of wondering about the meaning of life. I think spending time with kids might help.... Maybe you can take up teaching or something which makes you feel excited uk... Maybe watching cartoons ,tv or going to a concert..... Again this is just my opinion....... But all I can say is that just don't be hard on yourself... Try to let loose .... It helps"

Just venting,"One day I feel hopeful and motivated about life 
Then the next day I crash terribly and feel suicidal. 
I suffer from chronic depression but being in unhealthy relationship made my mental health worse and I feel trapped, if I leave I will be miserable without this person because I never loved anyone else and Im not able to love anyone other than him but staying with him is hell too. Sometimes I think death is the only solution ","Yes, at times I think that death is the only solution but then I think many there are a lot of things which can not be done once you are done. 
Just try to look for happiness, I am trying the same"
Should I even keep going ,"I feel like the cumulations of my recent border line personality disorder and my old diagnosis with autism is making my life genuinely not worth living. All my friends have left me since my dad died earlier this year. I feel like ever since I can’t shake this terrible feeling of loneliness and everyone I try to reach out to, even those who promised to be there just disappeared like the wind. Even my girlfriend 6 months left me two weeks prior to my dad’s death. I try to make and force friendships but they all just break and they disappear and only come around when forced to or what not and act like they can somewhat stand my presence just to ignore me again.",Time heals my friend good will happen to you if you truly wish for it.Were in the same position we have nothing to lose if we try to find new enjoyment and meaning dont give up just yet.Good luck.

HOW TO STOP LISTENING TO THAT VOICE?,"I recently turned 26 years old and I realized that my life has no meaning, I have no purposes or goals. I feel like I'm in ""automatic mode"" and nothing really matters to me and I wonder what I'm doing here?

Lost my home because I'm so broken. ,"I've completely ruined my relationship with my depression. I've been struggling for like 15 years at this point with recurring depression but the last 6 months ive lost everything. Ive become withdrawn and unable to cope, i cry everyday and i can't focus on anything. I've just started therapy but it just keeps bringing up more trauma from my past that i don't know where to put it, and now my partner wants to move out and live separately after 4 years of living together because she can't cope with me and it's making her depressed. She says it'll be good for us and that we can rekindle the joy in our lives by focusing on our struggles separately and kind of starting again with dating, but all i can feel is pain. I feel so upset she can't stand living with me, im afraid of trying to find and afford living alone, looking after myself on the day to day, i can barely get out of bed and now I've got less than a month to build a whole new life. I feel so broken and lost. I have friends around who all are offering to help, but the weight in my chest is so heavy i don't know how to go on anymore. She says we'll still be together and get to see eachother, but the feeling of being apart is so scary to me. She's my everything and i feel so upset that my depression is ruining our lives together. I just want to be loved and i want to feel less alone. Im trying so hard and every time i think it might be ok it gets worse and worse and now I'm losing the only thing that made me feel any kind of joy, coming home to her. I don't know how to cope anymore. I feel like i could just drop down dead, not through any action but just the pain in my heart and my head. ","Im so sorry, i'm going through a deep episode tho the conditions are completely distinct, i still can reassamble the feeling, tho i can't offer you any help, i hope you find the way to sort it out in the darkness you're in, hope things get better before you can tell."
How am I supposed to make a living with low energy,"Today, I got some low-paying work because of my mom, and I spent the whole day doing crafts and feeling mentally drained afterwards.

Depression exhausts me, how am I supposed to make a living with low energy, and I don't know what my future holds.","Be kind to yourself. The stress and worry of the first day at a new job would leave most people feeling very drained. Give yourself at least a few weeks to adjust and I'm confident that your energy levels wont deplete anywhere near as much.

You're now leaving the house, interacting with others and also got yourself a job. That's amazing progress and a huge achievement to be able to take all of that on in one hit. Seriously, well done!"

I do not say that my way is the good way, but I found a wfh job with flexible hours - I still need to take sick leaves when I can't function, but it's way better than nothing. 

Find a doctor if you haven't already. Let them help you to find the right meds to keep you afloat. Have some fresh air once for a while, try to rest - doing nothing, just relaxing. Research time management techniques (admittedly they never worked for me, but hey, taking a break is always good). Don't give up."

I don't know how to begin i have been trying to type this for the past 20 minutes and my anxiety is just killing me. please note i have autism

when i was a child. making friends was slightly easier. i could just go up to them and talk (or they go to my and do it since that's always how it worked then). its then now the hardest thing i can even do. i'm do scared to even approach people i don't know now. around when i was 9-12 were one of the best years of my life. i have had friends who have actually cared about me and i have actually had things in common with them. but i was just a child then. when i went to middle school i started having anxiety and it was bad to the point where i threw up before going there (only time thats ever happened to me). my parents have treated me like shit during that time it i felt worse. i switched middle schools hoping i would have a better experience there and it was worse. i have been treated shit like teachers around that time and i nearly hung myself because of them. my self esteem just dropped lower and lower. i knew i couldn't do anything because i had friends in different schools then and i didn't want to frighten them over my demise then. ever since high school i completely gave up the idea of making friends because of my anxiety is so bad i couldn't do anything about it. im too scared to take pills i've always been scared of them.

nearly a year after the pandemic happened i had a dream where i had a dream where i was with my childhood friends and i was dragged away into a dark hole. i have had more dreams of me spending time with my childhood friends and i feel so fucking pathetic that i couldn't even keep a promise to remain a good friend of my childhood friends. i have mostly since then been hanging out with my brothers friends then and since after i posted on suicidewatch i have been seeing my brothers friend nearly ever single day this year (i went to a different elem school than my brother). i have made a friend during the pandemic and now he's having a drug addiction and we've been distant this year.

a couple months ago i realized this year. after saving myself from suicide i wasted an entire year. i was supposed to get a job at may and i held it off hanging out with someone everyday who i don't even consider to be my best friend anymore and that ive eventually that he was a bad influence in me. i'm too scared too speak up about it because i feel like my brother is going to be an asshole about it. i reflected on my life since then i realized. i won't succeed, i've all the potential to be a person in society. i'm too pathetic to get a job. i feel like im never ever going to have a happy life anymore. im never going to heal from my depression i thought i'd get rid of. all i see in my future is just misfortune. i feel so unloved i wish i got rid of the desire to be in a relationship because i'm too pathetic. i know i am the problem. i can't even trust my parents anymore when it comes to my mental health after all the times they treated me like shit growing up during middle/high school. i plan on committing suicide in a certain date in a few years. i have no way of doing it now. i feel so fucking stupid for saying this but all i want at this point is to be loved, and thats never going to happen, im never going to find the right person to do it, my self esteem just goes lower and lower each year.i cant talk to my friends from then on how i feel because I feel like they don't care about me anymore because they've had way too separate lives ti even talk to me. im just that fucking pathetic","Praying for you homie as grim as things may seem drag you’re self out that deep dark shithole and become someone if not today tomorrow, you ain’t gotta be rich or famous jus find people you can love and who love you learn to love you’re self life’s special and the terrible shit you’re going through is just part of the beautiful shit sandwich life gives you , go out there drink a beer kiss a girl , scream out ur favorite song as loud as you can hang in there keep pushing random person across the world keep going homie ☝🏻"

If you love it someday it might feel good
I don’t know what to do anymore ,"So ig I’d like to start as I’m a 15-year-old girl, I do online school, and I have a boyfriend, I’ve been diagnosed with MDD or Major depressive disorder and I have also been diagnosed with anxiety, but I think I have insomnia too. My depression comes in waves and I think there is another wave right now, I feel horrible, lonely, unloved, and just all bad feelings like that, I don’t have any actual friends only my boyfriend but he’s bad with feelings, I never socialize with anyone outside of him and my family, I have one other person I talk to but he mostly just talks about how his life is so depressing and I’m so nice to him but it stresses me out because he randomly leaves and I think I did something wrong but he says when he feels bad he doesn’t like to talk much about it till after the fact but I’m the opposite and I feel useless because I can’t help. I need someone to hang out with someone to talk to I hate being alone yet I’m alone all the time. I lost weight I’m 94 pounds now I feel like I’m about to throw up all the time and my throat hurts from me crying, I feel weak and sick and I’m just over everything the only good thing about my life is sleeping, and my boyfriend but I barely get to see him and I physically can’t get myself to sleep until 5 am some days than other times I can’t sleep at all I feel for horrible to the point I’m physically sick and exhausted, and my mom won’t even pay for therapy she says because we don’t have insurance but she pays for counseling for her and her asshole husband that already showed multiple times he can’t change but yes don’t pay for your daughter who feels like this instead stay with a douche bag of a man. I’m so sick of everything I don’t know what to do I barely eat I’m not even that hungry anymore I just want to stop feeling like this all the time, I hate how people treat me, I hate that I feel like I’m sick all the time, I hate how everything is but I can’t do shit about it I tried to talk to my mom she said I can’t get a therapist yet, I talk to my brother he says his life is worse, I talk to my boyfriend he just says I’m sorry, I’m so over it sleeping is my only escape at least in my dreams people care. In so lost I just want help, sorry for the bad grammar.",if u want to talk to someone I'm here for u ik how u feel I've been thru it alot and it's very hard but pls don't give up
Just to vent,"Hey guys I have been having suicidal thoughts.  
Although on paper my life should be great. I have amazing friends and family, I got a decent job, Im going to college for a program that's hard to get into and I'm doing pretty good.  
However, despite all this, I feel depressed (undiagnosed) and have been having suicidal thoughts

Although I was close before, what stopped me was knowing how my friends and family would react since I was once on the receiving end after one of my friends had committed suicide.  
  
Anyways idk where else to go with this. I just wanted to yap and vent since I'm having another suicidal episode. Thx if you took the time to read yall",Hi friend. Looks like you might feel overwhelmed with school and work. I’m concerned you might burn yourself out. Take some time for yourself and relax or spend some time with friends to escape for a moment. It’s great you’re in school and working. It will pay off. Love you
I wasted my highschool years being depressed ,"I’m not going to get into details about my time in high school, but I was very depressed and isolated throughout my whole time there. Now that I'm 17 and it’s my last year in school, I’m doing online school and I can't go back to a physical school to make new friends due to zoning issues . Although I’ve been doing well mentally these past few months, I can’t help but feel bummed that I didn’t have the high school experience I could have had. I know I’m not the first person to deal with this, so if anyone out there has experienced something similar, please share how you managed it.",Hi friend I certainly had this issue. I attended 6 different high schools. So never made any connections with anyone. So I feel your pain. And even some people might have had an okay high school experience but now miss it. I would consider looking towards college. Be sure to join. Clubs and programs where to can make connections with others. Sadly I had done this but ruined it for myself. But that’s my problem. You can connect with so many people.
Need help,"Hey everyone I am 23m and I need help as I think something is wrong I don't feel like to achieve nor have any ambitious. It's like I just want to disappear from the world.
I am have dyslexia , high bp and migraine , have these from birth .These all 3 just makes me stop from doing anything in life I am super bad in studying, sports. I want to eat good taste food like pizza , burger but I can't have them as these food make me have the worst migraine and heart rate to point I need to admit to hospital. 
I don't even have friends I am all alone .
I don't know what I can do I am stuck I life , I just want to be normal . For outer world I look strong but deep down I am broken.
If anyone have any tips or guidance that can help me that would be great.","Tasty food isn't good food. Healthy food is good food.

I would say little exercise would be a good start for you. To keep you consistent and disciplined and energetic. 



For studies dude you have to see what makes learning and understanding easy for you. Maybe take some time . 



The truth is this is normal for you now. There is not much special you can do about this problem except acceptance. I would say socialize and talk to good people who are indeed helpful and understanding. It would help you on levels so you don't feel alone and different from others. Try to accept yourself. It's fine that you are that way. You will find a way out. Just do little small things to keep yourself happy and energetic"
"I’m scared, feel isolated pregnant and terrified. 34f married to 34m and I’m not sure what to do. I don’t know if I can move past the abuse ","I was talking to a coworker, and I was telling her about how when Noah and I first split up when I was 21 I had to prove to myself that I could provide for myself. I felt like I had to prove it to myself.

I did just that, I got rid of everything provided for me because it was tainted, he held it over my head.

And I did pretty well. I got into other relationships where the guys did provide for me but they didn’t hold it over my head.

Noah and I got back together at age 31, have been married almost two years, and he has taken the phone I’m holding in my hands from me when he was drunk because his mom gave it to me. He kept it from me for a couple hours while verbally abusing me and I couldn’t call the police or record him.
I went to get the phone and he put my on the garage floor with his knee in my chest.

We got into a fight and he changed the locks to the house on me. I spent a week staying with friends.

He bought the car I’m driving, he told me a couple weeks ago he would take it away and I’d have to start over again like i always do.

He paid for me to go to Costa Rica to see my family, my grandma is getting older and won’t be alive much longer. He held that over my head.

When he’s angry or drunk and angry this is his stuff, he’s done everything for me and he’s even called the police to try to get me out of the house when we were disagreeing.

He’s told me that I’m the reason my adoptive mom is crazy, he told me I am my father ( someone who molested me and three of my siblings and then killed himself) 

He calls my friends when I relapse ( I’m a recovering alcoholic) 


And the last time I did relapse I called a therapist and he listened in on the video cameras and called me because he said I wasn’t telling the whole story. 

The scary party is I told myself I’d never allow myself to be in this situation again. The even scarier part is I’m 6 months pregnant with his son and vulnerable. 

I had to make a new Reddit account because I feel so fuckin alone and he reads my posts and holds that over my head too. 

I’m a 34F and he’s 34M
","1. YOU have to call the police if he changes locks and keeps you out of your home.
2. YOU have to call the police when he holds you down and presses you against the floor. 
3. You have to divorce him and tbh he belongs in jail for the physical abuse.
4. You indeed have to do it all over again and start fresh and yes, you have to be self reliant and independent at all times. This is what it means to be an adult."

","That is terrible, I'm so sorry.  There may be local services that can help you leave, help pursue legal action against him, and help keep you safe. When you divorce, you should be entitled to alimony and child support.  Given the history of abuse, I expect you could get a restraining order, so he will not be able to see you or contact you.

I once found myself in an abusive relationship in a new city where I had no social support. I called the police after the physical abuse escalated. I was very surprised and impressed by the official support I received. He went to jail, and they offered me a restraining order. He was accompanied by police when he came to pick up his stuff.  I saw him peering through my windows while I had the restraining order, and the police found him and confronted him. It was scary, but the police and court were supportive. 

You will come out of this strong and free and capable of building a happier, more loving life for yourself and your child."

Need kind words ,"Holiday season makes everything hit harder. Had a bad week. One thing after the other, seems every time I trust and believe people they forget about me, let me down, or were just manipulating me. Got fired from my job. My birthday is coming up and I dont have anyone in my life who would put together a celebration or even give me a card. Longterm friends are all in other states.

I want to kill myself tonight to be done with everything. But I can’t do that to my kids. But I can’t keep feeling like this. I already cut myself bad today. I need to do it again but worse right now. That’s how I feel and I feel so alone. I don’t know what to do. ,Thank you so much. ♥️

I don’t know what to do. ,"i’ve felt this low for years and it’s honestly unbearable. but i’ve always kept a little bit of hope and faith that things will eventually turn out better and that i’ll truly feel happy. i’ve wrestled with the feeling that it’ll never happen. millions of times. i felt like i was losing that hope but i still feel like i have it. even at my worst. whatever is keeping you going is what you need to hold onto for dear life. whether it be your kids, your religious beliefs, whatever. keep that inside of your heart and although you will be pushed down a million and one times, you will always have that strength to keep pushing."
What is wrong with me?,"I dont understand whats going on with me at all. I have a life I know I should be grateful about, but im empty with no purpose. I have good grades, have a lot of free time and I get along well with my parents. I have some good friends even though my social life is practically dead. I was diagnosed with depression but it was not because any circunstance, it was completely my fault, or at least I feel like that. The problem is me, I cant get myself to take advantage of everything my parents gave me with their effort. I just waste my time in useless things, I feel like I should be always doing something productive to not feel like a waste. And the pressure of feeling that paralizes me. I had everything to be a great person but I ended up throwing everything away. I cant keep living with the guilt, but also I cant push myself to do anything. I feel like a total waste of a human, someone else could have done better instead of me. I cant even consider dying because it just would confirm that my life was a total waste. Im tired of living like this. ","I’ve felt and feel the same way. Something I’ve always been told is to stop, take a breath, and find a little moment for yourself. If you feel like you’re wasting your time, then there’s something you want to do right? Go for it! I often hold myself back from pursuing what I want but neither of us should do that!"

I don’t know if I can keep going but if I kill myself I know my parents won’t recover ,"I am at a point where I really just don’t think I can keep going, but when I think about ending it, I know how much pain my parents would be in. But I am just so tired. 

I have a long history of trauma. I was physically, sexually, and emotionally abused by my stepfather for about 10 years. My mom didn’t protect me. In fact, when I finally got the courage to go to the police and report my stepdad for sexual abuse at 15, my mom chose his side. She bailed him out of jail and lied about me on the stand when it went to trial. He was found not guilty and they are still married. I have not spoken to my mom since the trial. 

I ended up moving in with my dad and who would later become my stepmom. We strengthened our relationship and I know they love me, but I don’t really talk to them about who I really am or how I really feel. I’m often playing a part around them of a happy daughter. 

Due to a lack of boundaries and low self worth, I’ve also experienced more sexual trauma in my adulthood - being taken advantage of by men I thought were friends, being talked into sending sexual images and then blackmailed over them, dating men that have repeatedly disrespected me and cheated on me, etc. 

My last boyfriend I was madly in love with but he lied to me and cheated on me multiple times. I finally had to end it two years ago but I’ve never really recovered from it. I still miss him daily even though he didn’t treat me very well. I’ve felt really numb the past 2 years. 

I also have a lot of credit card debt (I was laid off twice in the past 3 years and unemployed for long periods of time) and I’ve gained 20 pounds this year. I don’t feel motivated to do anything anymore. My apartment is a mess and I just can’t clean it. I have a list of things I need to do in my head but I can’t seem to do them. All I really want to do is lay in my bed. I’ve felt my mental health deteriorate a lot this past year. I cry a lot. I think I deeply hate myself, but I don’t know how not to.

I have tried to experience life and make it worth living - I have traveled, moved to different cities, made friends, tried out hobbies, etc. And I am grateful for many things. I just don’t feel intrinsically motivated anymore. I never feel like I’m doing good enough or that I myself am good enough. Even when things are “good,” I don’t feel like I deserve it. 

I just don’t want to do this anymore. I’m 30 now and I’ve been thinking about killing myself for almost 2 decades. But I know how hard my dad would take it so I don’t feel like I can do that. I don’t know how to find it in me to keep going though. Sometimes I feel like I am already dead and I’m pulling my corpse through this life just so I don’t cause other people pain. 

Sorry this is so long. I don’t really have anyone to talk to about these things, I don’t want my friends or family to worry about me. So I guess I thought I’d see if anyone here has gone through something similar and what has helped them keep going.
Thank you 🖤","You’re not alone, I’m 29 and feel the exact same way. The thought of what would happen to my parents if I killed myself is basically the only thing keeping me here. People say it gets better but that hasn’t been my experience. Every time I think things are getting better I end up being wrong. I don’t really have any advice for you, if I knew how to solve this problem then I wouldn’t be in this situation myself. But I hope that your situation is different and things get better for you. 

I guess if I had to think of something that’s been helpful, it’s been talking to people in my life and letting them know that I’m not okay. I used to feel like I couldn’t talk to my parents about how I was feeling because I felt like I needed to protect them but it’s helpful to not feel like you’re experiencing these things alone. My mom doesn’t really understand depression and she’s not always super helpful but she tries, and it does help to feel like you have somewhat of a support system"
"Why do I get so depressed during happy, social events? Small or large","Maybe I’m just tired, but everytime I have a birthday or any gathering that I should be participating in, I get this overwhelming sadness/emptiness that shuts me down, leading me to retreat to another room and disappearing into my own mind. I have a theory that it is because there is no “escape” from these events and I feel pressured to participate even though I should be having a great time and not worrying about it at all. I’m just in my living room typing this while the fam (who I don’t see too often) talk and catch up, and I can’t help but feel guilty that I don’t want to/feel like participating.",Holiday depression. I have this happen too. For me though it’s more like a realization that holidays or birthdays will never be as good as when I was a kid. Just trying to say that a lot of people feel this way about holidays and events.
Suicide ,I was this close to unaliving myself. But today I chose not to. ,Nice. Keep it that way. You can get through this brother 💪💪
Suicide ,I was this close to unaliving myself. But today I chose not to. ,"I just wake up and look for reasons to stay. And remember it’s temporary. Dark times don’t last forever! I’ve been through so many dark times and always manage to pull through and be ok. I’m back now because I’m in dark times again,and it’s really hard to get through the day but I keep telling myself it will get better. Stay strong❤️ you’re not alone!!!! You have so many people fighting with you and we can’t let this disease win!!"
Suicide ,I was this close to unaliving myself. But today I chose not to. ,It’s not as easy as one thinks. And it’s easier to find one tiny little thing that makes you ok for now. And that is all you need to worry about because one day it’ll all be over anyway. I’m 52 and have been trying since I was 5. It’s been 2 years of not trying and instead finding tiny joys each day to keep me going. The understanding that eventually it’ll all stop anyway is a relief. Maybe that comes from old age or many failed attempts and hospitalisations but fuck it. It will end anyway. So hang in there and find a tiny joy each day my friend.

Also, idk if you have tried medication but that’s what helped me. Lexapro is what I started in late 2020 and it was a life saver literally.

Suicide ,I was this close to unaliving myself. But today I chose not to. ,"For me, every time it gets that close to not wanting to go on, I know something in my life, some tether leeching from me has to be cut. I cut it as opposed to cutting my lifeline.

Suicide ,I was this close to unaliving myself. But today I chose not to. ,"I don't want to actually kill myself.  I want to kill this thing inside me. And the only way I see is by unaliving myself.

And even outside, anhedonia does not have a treatment"

And now I don't know what to do and what I want.

They seem to have functional lifestyles while I just feel like depressing energy. I don’t want to be a burden but it’s almost like people can sense it for how quiet I’ve been.

If that makes u feel any better and also try not to force ur self to be positive be yourself it’s very important to remain kind and respectful to those around u and ur self as well. But the most u can do is atleast try .. think about how worse it’ll be if u don’t try and when u look back on ur life ur gonna beat ur self up and say what could have been .. atleast when u try u prove to ur self that u actually did something to help ur self .. even if u fail .. it matters that u tried the best thing in life u can do for ur self is persevere it gets tiring . But ultimately you’ll ststst to learn along the way to just be .. but in the most tolerant way you can exist to ur self

No sad just very apathetic ,"I don’t see a reason for me to continue living I don’t know if it’s depression or what but I just wanna die I have no future no passion no talent I’m just a husk of a person the only thing I look forward to in life is hollow knight silk song and gta 6 but that’s really it 

I’m 18 with no job no license 
My dad pressures me to get one or the other but I don’t wanna work because I’m lazy 
And I’m scared of driving probably because I’ve been in a few too many accidents in my life and that is NOT the way I wanna go out 

My gpa is like 1.5 I absolutely hate school and have no future in education 
Everyone says I’m pretty smart and I should be getting good grades but the reality is I couldn’t give a fuck and seriously don’t even think I’m going to graduate 

At this point in life I have disappointed everyone’s expectations including my own 

All my friends are going places or at least further than me 
And I can’t help but feel jealous 
Regardless though I made my bed so I’ll just have to lay in it 

I felt this way for a very long time 

I have no one to talk to about this either 
All my friends are online and they’re all highschool teenagers (assholes)

My family doesn’t believe in depression 
and when they found out my older sister was cutting herself my eldest sister gave her a knife and told her to keep doing it so that’s definitely a no go

I don’t fit in anywhere either in fact I was bullied for practically my whole life including by my siblings and cousins in fact the entire reason I got into video games was because my cousins wouldn’t let me watch them play so my dad got me a DS

I remember one time they ganged up on me and pushed me into an ant pile and I ended up getting bit by a bunch of red ants on my back
Not a very fun memory 
But they’re all grown adults now and probably don’t remember it

There was another time I was walking home from school and one of my *friends* pushed me onto the ground and sat on top of me and I was so scrawny at the time I couldn’t push myself up 
I had to wait until my mom eventually spotted us in the street and told him to get off 

I don’t mean to share a sob story cause it’s in the past I’m just painting a picture of my circumstances 

I’m 5’6 fat and ugly now and I don’t do anything about it because I quite frankly don’t care anymore 
And I really don’t see how it would help me 

My future plan is just to jump off a bridge or something but the tallest bridge near me isn’t high enough soo idk

Anyway I had to rant or else I’d blow up or something thanks for reading ","I'm sorry. People are so stupid and closed-minded they don't care enough to understand the world from another person's perspective, so I wouldn't count on the people who bullied you or don't ""believe"" in your depression to change. I have nothing good to say to you, I really don't. But if you care enough to post an essay about how shitty your life is online, I'm sure there is something that can motivate you to try and change your situation, right? I'm 18 as well and am stuck with recurring thoughts that I'll never find love and a fulfilling life because of how short I am, so just know that you're not alone in this feeling. There are people out there just like you who are in the same situation,  at least that thought gives me comfort"

I feel as if I've reached the end...,"This is not a suicidal post, I'm not suicidal, probably too tired for something like this anyway. I'm 39 and I pretty much ruined my life. Getting 40 next year is unimaginably frightening because it highlights that I've truly achieved nothing. I've been suffering from depression and anxiety disorder for almost 20 years now, have no job, no partner, no children, my best friend died four years ago (I don't seem to get over that at all since then), my last remaining friends have given up on me and most of my family bully me half of the time. 

I guess I wrote this because I often used to sugarcoat the shitshow my life has become. I wish I could change it, change myself and my thought pattern. I wish I could feel happiness and trust again. I've lost a lot and I miss a person who loves me. I really wish I had lead a better life, I wish I had friends or a little family like my cousins...","You’ve reached the end of nothing. Depression has been putting you down for 20 years but you are here and this is not the end of your life. Inner resilience is something depression cannot overcome.

I'm tired af I wanna end it all ,"Good evening, it's 0:30, December 1.
I'm writing here because I'm really tired and writing everything I feel in notes doesn't help me anymore, I haven't even been to a psychologist for years.
I'm in a pretty bad situation in my life, with no money in my pocket, at an age when I should at least have my life a little better organized, but instead I have severe suicidal thoughts, daily arguments in my family. I've come to victimize myself a lot, to feel like I'm losing myself, I started drinking alcohol every day just to wait for time to pass faster.
Since I was born I was told that I had serious health problems and that I wouldn't be able to survive for long, my parents tried as much as they could to raise my morale, but in the end they didn't manage to do much, I still fell deeper into depression. I have had many suicide attempts, for various reasons, why I can't make friends, why I have these health problems, why I am in constant pain, why I don't have money to enjoy something, why I can't enjoy what I already have, and the list goes on. I have made bad choices in my life, out of pure selfishness, because I didn't have such a high emotional intelligence to make concrete choices.
And now in conclusion. I am very tired, I don't want to continue. All I want is to stop here and sleep, for everything to pass by me. I am tired of myself and everything around me.",Im feeling the same
forgetting,"Is there a way to like just forget your problems and just be in a state of calm. I don’t want to drink, smoke, do drugs etc I just want to feel calm naturally ",Yes but you have to have had some form of trauma. Many people are able to block out negative experiences due to this.
forgetting,"Is there a way to like just forget your problems and just be in a state of calm. I don’t want to drink, smoke, do drugs etc I just want to feel calm naturally ",I wish I knew the right answer. Therapist’s just tell me to breathe in & out to feel calmer naturally but I find distracting myself doing things I like is the only way to push through & feel calmer like playing video games & colouring in better but it’s only temporary.

"God, this feels so terrible","

It feels so terrible to be this alone. To wish, more than anything, that anyone out there would even notice me enough to be able to see how I am falling apart. But I am so far away from everyone, even when they're right there. I just want someone to care. I just want someone to ask me, to say ""are you okay?"" Just because they care about me, without me having to beg them to first. I can't do this. I can't keep fucking doing this. My first and last thought of every day is suicide. I can't do this for the rest of my life, I don't even know if I can do this for another year or month. And I see posts on subreddits like this of people in their 40s or rarely 50s and I think, ""why? Why even bother? Why try so hard to stay here when I could keep feeling this awful for another 30 years? Why not put a bullet in my mouth right now?""",It’s hard but it’s possible to live alone. Never beg someone to love you. I feel the same way if you wanna talk

It feels like you’re inside my mind rn. I’ve had the same thoughts as you. For what it’s worth, I hope that one day soon you’ll feel better. I’d ask if you’re okay, but I can see you’re hurting. And I know how hard it is to be feeling like this, yet the people around you don’t seem to care. What I’ve had to come to terms with is that you can’t control what other people do. You can’t wish them into asking the right questions. Seeing you and the right moment. How lovely and relieving it would be yes… but, what can also be relieving it speaking up. Reaching out can get you the same result you’re yearning for. It takes courage, and the right person to hear you. But once you do it, you start to feel less alone. A friend, a family member, coworker, boss, mental health professional, a stranger online, once it’s out there, and you admit, “hey I’m actually really struggling mentally right now and I feel … and I’m trying to deal with … but I’m having a hard time”… the relief is worth it. People are usually clueless because dealing with their own things. Speak out and you’ll realise how you truely are not alone. You never know, a person you interact with every day may be waiting for the same kind of situation. It takes one conversation to connect with someone. Create the space, don’t wait for it to come, otherwise you may end up like those 40/50 yrs who still haven’t reached out because they’re afraid."

However, a switch up is what is needed more than anything. Something super simple like going for a walk or taking a different route to work etc is enough to jumpstart your brain again. It shows you there is more to life. Plan super small things that are totally different from what you do now and ideally make them harder and harder.

I don’t feel like there’s a place for me in life,Everywhere I try to fit in I feel like I don’t belong. I feel socially stunted and awkward like I can’t keep basic relationships with people. Physically I also don’t fit in I’m big and clumsy I can’t even find shoes my size. There’s just days where I wonder why even try anymore? I just feel so numb and alone. I’ve been in counseling but every time things seem to be looking up it just crumbles all over again.,"Have you tried helping other people, volunteering? I'm not trying to be insensitive to you wanting help yourself. But I found for me the best thing that helped my confidence was helping other people. Because at that point who cares about any of those things I was worrying about? This person (or animal, or park, or whatever) needed help and I did that. You can see the evidence and it's really hard to feel like a waste when you can give that to someone. Even the smallest thing, how are you gonna argue that you being there didn't make it at least a little better? Then you start applying that elsewhere"

Does it ever get better? Like actually ,"Hi I am an 18 year old girl and I suffer from depression. Last night i got a wellness check to my house after calling the suicide hotline. I was ashamed while I sat in the back of the cop car because I just felt like I had absolutely no control of my emotions anymore. 

Even though i have had many therapists, i never really got help or healed from childhood trauma. Also, my parents have a history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, anger issues. 

I’m going through a hard break up right now. I’ll spare the details but let’s just say in terms of depression, this person “healed” me. When he loved me, it was like it healed a part of my inner child. We were together almost two years, i even was pregnant with his baby at some point. He recently just broke up with me and ended it for good, no closure, said the worst possible things to me to hurt me in purpose, is already moving on and sleeping with other girls. I am miserable and so hurt, I feel so alone and I have no idea how to deal with this. 

I have just lost hope and I feel like I will never be happy. I can’t even explain how miserable I feel. I want my life to be ended so i don’t feel like this but i don’t want to physically kill myself. 

I found out that I can go to the ER and have an evaluation and most likely get diagnosed/ and or prescribed something. I will probably do that after work today. I wanted to work because my coworkers feel like a family and I only work two times per week.

Another thing I will add, when i was 16 I was diagnosed with depression and prescribed prozac, it helped and for a moment of time I was overjoyed. But then the effects went down and upping my dose didn’t help. 

I was stupid and I stopped going to the appointments and that’s when I fell in to this relationship. 

That’s why I think going to a doctor will help but I just feel so far gone because my life is completely different now. I had friends then, now i don’t. I still had motivation to get up and get ready everyday, and now i don’t. I had hope i would get better. My life was just so much better then, but I was still depressed. I was just a teenage girl who didn’t really know how life was, and now that i’m on my own I see adult life as kind of miserable and not “exciting” like i always thought. Now my life is so lonely and I don’t know I just feel like nothings going to help. I really don’t know where to go from here. 

Sorry that was long but thank you for reading.","Try the meds again. What have you got to lose? 

To answer your question, yes, it absolutely does. Even if the circumstances don't get astronomically better, your perception of them and your general mood absolutely can and will if you make it a priority. I will also say loneliness kills. Make friends again. On Reddit, in group therapy, it doesn't matter."

How Does One Confront the Shadows of the Mind?,"Dealing with a mental illness is one of the most harrowing experiences a person can face. Conditions like anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or bipolar disorder are not just temporary issues; they are internal battles fought day after day, with no clear guide on how to overcome them. The greatest challenge lies in the fact that, unlike physical injuries, the wounds in the mind are invisible, creating a sense of isolation and misunderstanding, both from others and the person affected.

The stigma surrounding mental illnesses exacerbates the suffering. There is constant pressure for individuals to hide their internal struggles for fear of being judged, ridiculed, or labeled as ""weak."" However, what is often misunderstood is that asking for help is not a sign of weakness but a recognition of the importance of emotional well-being and the need for support—something that everyone, to some degree, requires.

Furthermore, people battling mental illness find themselves trapped between their desire to ""overcome"" and the reality that recovery is a long and complicated process. Despite advances in treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and medications, there is still a long way to go in terms of social acceptance and professional understanding.

In this context, it is crucial to create safe spaces where individuals can openly discuss their difficulties without fear of judgment and receive the appropriate support to face their mental battles. The struggle against the shadows of the mind is real, but with understanding and proper accompaniment, progress toward the light is possible.","Drugs and disassociation for me. I'm responsible and work a decent job still tho. I have had many overcoming moments, but it's always 1 step forward and 2 steps back. It varies so much from person to person too. I've accepted that no matter what I'll always feel this way, and my personal choice was to keep going for the sake of my loved ones, which I don't mind doing at this point. For others, we all know they don't see any way out. Some people will feel loads better with medication, or therapy, or a lifestyle change, it's different for everyone. What works for one person may not work for another. It's so unique to the individual, and that's why it's so hard to actually treat people effectively"

I remember in high school too, I felt really hated. I answered a question in a class where I did esp poorly, and the class clapped after it. 

I still think everyone hated me, but in fact i've been told I was liked, and some, sadly, felt bad for me and knew I was struggiing.  People don't really 'hate' you unless they know you did something to be hated for. If they don't know you, it's rarely someone's take on a stranger that they hate them, however we think or surmise that to be their read of us."

You're going into interactions and conversations with the expectation that folks won't engage or already don't like you because of what's going on in your head. Almost like they can hear your thoughts (might be a bad analogy). Logically, unless you're wearing your emotions on your sleave, people can't jump to conclusions like that (although some do, they suck though so pay no mind). It's super hard, might be impossible for some, but go into interactions/conversations with different expectations. Breaking things down logically can help this. My brain tells me this shit ALL the time, but sometimes just talking to people can break that illusion. Think about the other person too, ask them stuff about their life, take a genuine interest, and any logical reasonable person should pay that courtesy back. Always look for reasons for why you feel a certain way and then combat those reasons directly. Just my two cents. Keep your chin up!"

I'm going through these feelings heavily, I'm not upset or angry bla bla bla, but I want to end it all, the only thing stopping me is my parents, I'm 34, they're in there 60s and my relationship and Upbringing with them was and is brilliant, I owe it to them.

But those I love friends and partner wise I always partly self sabotage unknowingly (cliche defence mechanism) or they just don't know enough or care enough, everyone has they're own lives and issues, who am I to burden them.

I'm an incredibly creative person and find therapy doesn't work, no matter how deep or true it is, in my case THOUGH for those who are lost and lonely I'd defnitly recommend it.r"

The election period has really intensified anger, hate, sadness, exclusion, division, bias, etc, so i'm glad it's at least over, in the sort of way it is. 

For example, assumed or accurate reads of other's feelings happens a lot when we are in a retail setting:

the clerk may be down about some bad thing at home, being broke, the last mean customer, or have depression, and their mood is perceived by the customer as directed at them, or caused by them. Other customers might think your bad mood is of a judgement about them, and respond in a negatiive way.  They may think you're being snooty, snobby or just superior and judge you for it, their take on you.  What you have you're going to buy may be judged, you judging others, how you're dressed, distances, words said or not, it's a hotbed for heightened feelings, that teaches us about how ppl interact and feel toward others in general."

I am not buying myself anything as it doesn't feel right. Over the past years i completely lost interest in everything, hobbies aren't interesting and i don't look forward to anything.

I was able to be a bit ""spontaneous"" and convinced myself i deserve to get a new phone.

And not sure if tonorrow will be ""the right momennt"".

Why am i like this? Why do i always delay opening presents, using what i bought myself (same with shoes, clothes)....","Some things that popped into my head...

I wonder if you might have unconsciously traned yourself to stay away from anything that could give you a positive emotion because you wouldn't be able to cope if it were to go wrong for any reason?

Maybe over time you've unconsciously cultivated what feels like a safe space to you and changing that in any way could disrupt the nice and steady everyday emotions that feel familiar to you?

Could it be a way of giving you a feeling of control. Maybe you have/had trouble with controlling other aspects of your life and this is a way to regain that back?

Is this a way that you can punish yourself for any reason?

What do you think holds you back from opening new things and have you given it much thought? That's much more important than anything I think.

I personally think you deserve to open something nice that you've worked hard for. Would you be open to giving it a try? It will probably feel pretty good!"

First, DON'T EVER believe her that it is your ""failure"" to feel this way. It is sth that we can't control and we don't enjoy it either. It is hard, okay? Dont make it even harder by feeling as a failure.
Imagine someone is having an heart attack for the second time in their lives and someone comes and screams at them that they have failed their health instead of helping them. It sounds like a cruel nonsense right? It is the same for your case.


Secondly, it is a verbal abuse. And no, autism doesn't make you act this way. And even if it does (it doesnt), that is not an excuse to blame someone in pain for the pain they experience. It is inhuman. She is being an indiffirent unemphatetic asshole. I would leave her asap"

She was never supportive and always acted like I was trying to garner attention from my actions, or that I was simply 'lazy'. All the while acting like the ideal person around others others we spoke about mental health. 

I ignored this because I loved her. We had three children and as responsibility, life, financial issues and work grew and grew, my depression went up and down. Soon, my wife started to blame me, telling me i was a terrible person and that i was affecting my children negatively. Then she left. 

Amazingly, the children all blame her now, and spend more time at my house than hers. 

Moral of the story: I should have listened to my instincts early in the relationship. She was showing her true colours. She never gave a shit. She didn't want to help. I should have escaped early. I didntbut you can."

","I think it’s the verbiage which was off putting for me as well. « They’re babied a lot » is a blanket statement that is also a pretty big assumption. A better way to phrase it without changing much on anything would have been to say « A lot of autistic people are babied » (which is still a little eh) but would have been taken better if followed by something of an explanation as well like « Because some traits caused by autism can resemble misbehavior and vice versa it can result in, at times, misbehavior being left unaddressed or overlooked, unintentionally. It’s possible parents or caregivers of autistic children may inadvertently reinforce behaviors that, while possibly rooted in autism, can be better understood and managed through appropriate guidance and techniques. It’s common for parents to want to shield them from challenges, as many parents would, and like it would for any child this could hinder their development. »  

Obviously not necessary to say it in so many words, I have a tendency to over explain, but the blanket statement without any context or explanation is what’s earning those downvotes. Even as someone who understands your sentiment, as I’m guilty of it on occasion, the phrasing and tone gave me pause."

CW: In-depth description of suicide attempt.

I just got back home after a failed suicide attempt. I had everything prepared: repared: a hangman’s noose, a 3-step ladder, and a large tree in a very remote area at night where no one was around. If I had gone through with it, I almost certainly wouldn’t be writing this now. The only thing that stopped me was the cold and darkness. As an autistic person, I am extremely sensitive to cold weather and water, and this physical discomfort ultimately held me back. To be clear, this wasn’t a change of heart or a realization that I wanted to live—it was an instinctive, sensory-driven reaction that overpowered my reasoning. If anything, it has augmented my sense of entrapment. 

I’m now back at my apartment, where the conditions are much warmer. While I’d prefer to attempt something similar in an indoor setting like this, I suspect that most indoor structures—even in older apartments or buildings—aren’t suited to making such an attempt successful. For instance, where could I hang a noose that could support my weight without being noticed by my roommates? As a result, I’m now faced with either overcoming my instinctive reactions or finding another method.

That said, as I mentioned earlier, this situation has only deepened my sense of entrapment. I feel like my body & mine are composed of irrational & intrinsic impulses which deny me my own right to determine my trajectory. And without going into too much detail about my personal life, I don’t have anyone who is willing or able to support me in a way that could meaningfully change the status quo.","I totally get what you're going through, man. I've been there myself, and it's tough. Every time I think about doing something like that, a little voice inside me tells me it's not worth it. There are so many better things to do with your life. Trust me, things will get better. Just hang in there."

I don’t think I’m capable of feeling happy ,"I genuinely don’t believe I’m capable of feeling real happiness or even feeling similar emotions/things which are associated with it, like love. I just feel like a shell of myself. Like there is only the heap of numbness that lives within me always. 

I tell myself I want to feel it and the few times I’ve tried life finds a way of either ripping out from under me or cruelly reminding me why I don’t deserve it. 

I’m so tired and exhausted by this and I don’t know how to keep going on. There’s too much time left to feel this same way every day for the rest of my sorry life. ","I hear you, and just know that you aren’t alone. I’m not quite sure what keeps me going at this point. I’m just on auto pilot."
Help Me Eat Healthy ,"Please, please drop any healthy eating tips you have when you’re really struggling with depression and zero motivation.  I haven’t eaten all day because I just can’t get out of bed. And I’m feeling like crap because of it. I also desperately want to lose weight, but it can be difficult when im opting for convenient easy prepackaged foods.

Any recipes or tips you have are so welcome and appreciated. I have no issue paying more for convenience, however I am located in a very rural area so we just have a small local grocery store, no costcos or trader Joes or anything like that!

Thank you so much! ",Do exercise that burns 300 calories. Then you will have a mental value of how much that 300 calorie snack bar 'costs' in real terms.

Every doctor I saw said it will just go away someday and nothing could be done.  Guess what it finally did.

Block your nose and pop your ears if you hear air escape you got a hole in your eardrum.
Clean your ears with soap and water and then rinse with water, go to bed.
Smoke some weed
Hop on a threadmill till your head is hot
Blow out your nose
Hang upside down till you feel it in your head
Turn your head in a circle motion


When i had a clogged ear and got it flushed bg a doctor i heard everything very loud for a couple days as if i was superman then it went back to normal. Sometimes i get tinnitus but not very loud, just sea noises or i hear my heartbeat."

"Why do people scream ""Why can't you think about MY feelings!"" to their seriously suicidal family/friend?","As y'all know it was Thanksgiving n people were having family gatherings. Inevitably something bad was doomed to happen. Yesterday I had to take my best self-control to not scream at my sister-in-law. She was constantly irritating and provoking her suicidal son. God I almost think she was intentionally doing that. 

I can't understand why some people have the fucking audacity to scream at their suicidal family with ""WHY CAN'T YOU THINK ABOUT **MY** FEELINGS FIRST?!"" Bitch, your baby boy is poisoned with Depression and is on the verge of killing himself but then you as a parent wants to prioritize *your* feelings before theirs? They can barely function and take care of themselves and you demand them to put your narcissistic ass in the 1st place??? That's not logically nor emotionally correct. 

And, OMFG, why is that a parent always fails to realize the responsibility is on them if their child is depressed? It's a parent's main fucking job to NOT get their precious baby depressed and suicidal.

Also WTF was that attitude? **ANYONE** knows you shouldn't ""motivate"" a suicidal person by stimulating or upsetting them especially in a situation like in a family gathering. What the FUCK was that woman even thinking? God I'm so pissed. 

 I was never close to my brother and sister-in-law due to massive age gap and he was absent from the party due to him always working overseas. Therefore I couldn't say much in this matter in front of everyone. And tbh it was even my first time acknowledging that my nephew is depressed and very, very suicidal. I'm extremely angry at his parents for doing my little nephew so wrong. He was a sunny silly little turd producing machine in my memory and suddenly I almost lost him to depression... I hate myself for being so oblivious about his well-being. I feel like a fucking failure. As an experienced depression haver and bullying victim I'm currently doing my best to help my nephew. 

How I wish I could strip his parents with parental rights and take him under my name. Apparently he wanted to ask help from me before but since ""being depressed is shameful"" his mother talked him into ""be quiet"" about this. Also, because I'm the ""shameless and gay"" uncle I definitely have ""a bad influence on children"" so ""you should avoid him at all cost"". Those are **all** his mother's words. Imagine my rage when I heard this from my nephew. Me or other people could've helped him and likely to avoid him becoming depressed if he wasn't taught to be quiet about it. He needed only to ask. But his own mother took that opportunity from him. I weren't even this angry when I was bullied for being gay. God I HATE narcissistic and arrogant parents like my sister-in-law. They really don't deserve to have children. 
","I'm gonna have a word with my brother tomorrow and hope he could help his son too. Please wish my nephew good luck everyone. Really wish he could get better and enjoy life like kids his age should be doing. Oh I seriously hate myself for not noticing his personality changes and radio silent from his social media. I could've helped if I were more careful. How could I fail to spot another depressed soul in need of help, and wait, in my own family? I'm really no better than his mother."

They really don't deserve to have children. 
","Sorry if I misunderstood anything by the way.. As a suicidal person with no one to turn to for help, I just want to let you know that I know your nephew appreciates your help, even if you didn't help prior to finding out. As the saying goes— ""It's better to be late than never"". As long as you're supporting him and trying to help, you're not a failure. The real failure is his mother who allowed this to happen in the first place. How could she even tell her son to be quiet about it because it's shameful? How is she not embarrassed? I don't mean to disrespect any of your family members, but she honestly needs help. If she thinks that her feelings are more important than her suicidal son's then I don't even know what to say. She shouldn't have the right to be his mom or even have children in the first place with that mentality. Please don't blame yourself for not noticing earlier, it's... not easy to notice these things because of how complex humans really are. The important thing is that you're trying your best, and as I said, I'm sure your nephew appreciates it. I wish you both the best and I hope the talk with your brother goes well ♡ Sending you and your nephew and brother lots of wishes"

I'm not saying this is you but I have observed it in people including myself. We don't believe the people we know can help and therefore they can't. Or maybe they just really can't I guess my point is the same. Go meet some new people, in the same place as you, and just talk to them. Try to help them with your own perspective and what you've learned from it. It worked like magic for me"

My mom gets mad for being mentally ill. Just wanted to post this cuz this is the only place I can let my feelings out.,"I've been asking my mom to take me to a psychiatrist or therapy but all she says is that I'm going to be manipulated with medication or that I'm able to think logically so there's nothing wrong with my mental condition. I just fought with my mom again and she said that I'm saying I'm mentally ill just to run away from school and exams. I've had enough and started panicking, screaming, banging on walls, touching fire and stuff. She doesn't seem to be worried tho. She doesn't want to admit that I'm struggling mentally. At this point, I'm feeling empty. I was clean for months. Oh well shes never going to understand. ",Try to get someone from school (teacher you trust?) or social worker to help you. Good luck!
Struggling with Depression and Relationship Regrets,"
I’m feeling pretty down lately and needed a space to share my thoughts. I’ve been battling depression for a while now, and it really affected my most recent relationship. Looking back, I realize I wasn’t the partner I wanted to be. I often felt detached and emotionally drained, which made it hard to be present and appreciate the good things in my relationship.

I think one of the hardest things is the regret. I told my ex that I was depressed while we were dating, and I regret how I communicated it. I worry that it made her feel like she was part of the problem when, in reality, it was my own internal struggle. I just didn’t know how to express it in a way that didn’t hurt her.

We’re no longer in contact, and while I know apologizing could bring some closure, I also know it can’t change the past. It’s hard to move on when I feel so stuck in my own head.

If anyone else has dealt with similar feelings—whether it’s depression, regret, or struggling to balance mental health with relationships—I’d really appreciate your perspective. How did you find a way forward?

Struggling with Depression and Relationship Regrets,"
I’m feeling pretty down lately and needed a space to share my thoughts. I’ve been battling depression for a while now, and it really affected my most recent relationship. Looking back, I realize I wasn’t the partner I wanted to be. I often felt detached and emotionally drained, which made it hard to be present and appreciate the good things in my relationship.

Thanks for reading. It helps just to get this out.",Recognizing that’s not who you want to be means you’ve already made progress. I’d leave the past where it’s at and focus on the lesson you got from it. I’ve struggled with depression and med changes that have made me absent and detached as well. I fear becoming that way again because I want to be there and be stable for my partner. Keep pushing forward and practice mindfulness and grounding techniques that will help you be more present in the future.
"Depressed during the day, fine at night?","So, I just found out that a thing called ""reverse seasonal affective disorder"" is a thing? I've started noticing this weird trend where all day i feel like absolute trash but as soon as it gets dark out, all of a sudden I feel almost normal? I've just moved from a place where it's dark most of the day for about 7 months to a place where the sun almost never stops shining (...i hate deserts, let me tell you...) and I think that might have something to do with it? Does that even make sense?

My guess is because I'm used to it being dark during the winter, my subconscious is flipped because it's ""too bright"" for almost December and doesn't know what to do now?

Has anyone else experienced this..?","I’ve had that before though this time around I’m in the opposite boat, but I’ve found that my adhd meds help quite a bit during the day. But in the past, I’ve found that when it gets dark out it’s kind of a reset for me for some reason, and usually the late afternoon would be the worst time of the day, and morning the best. Could just be the light though. Not sure"

don't make it about how bad you're feeling that he's depressed or say ""i feel like it's my fault"" cause you'll most likely make him feel bad for being depressed. try to have an honest discussion where you listen to him and his needs, don't just wait for your turn to speak

Happily Suicidal?,"Not sure if this is a cry for help or just word vomit. I'm very confused about myself and life in general.

I used to (maybe still?) have some pretty bad depression for about a decade, but several pills and therapies later I thought I'd gotten over it. For the last few years my life's been pretty good and it's looking pretty good for the foreseeable future... And yet I can't stop fetishisizing death. I fantasize about different ways to die multiple times a day. I'll be daydreaming, people will ask, ""what are you thinking about"" I'll say, ""nothing"" but it's literally always about death.

I've not made an active attempt on my life in many years and I'm kind of glad I failed the two times I tried. I've seen and appreciated so much beauty in those years afforded to me. And yet, as great as it all is, it just doesn't seem to scratch this very specific itch inside of me. I get all warm and fuzzy inside, even positively unadulteratedly ecstatic on multiple occasions. I have great partners, friends and family and I'm incredibly easy to please and there is a lot of satisfaction to the things I do. But none of it seems to quite emotionally reach that place that I believe death would. I don't even know why I think death would scratch this itch better. It's just this ever present thought, who's origins elude me. Anyone maybe similar with better ideas on what it could be?

I'm not even sure I want to be cured of this ""affliction"". I quite like who I am. Don't get me wrong I'm incredibly flawed but I think the lack of fucks afforded to me by not caring about the worse case scenario of any situation I'll be in is fantastic. But I do sometimes worry one day, on a complete whim, I'll jump in front of a train or off a bridge, OD on something I've never tried before, maybe even shoot myself in the face with a massive smile. People I care about would be sad though and I don't wanna do that to them but sometimes I fear my rational mind will falter to this one desire I can't seem to get away from.

I don't even know if I'm suicidal or not. I'm very happy on balance and yet keep putting myself in dangerous situations. Climbing derelict buildings, walks in the woods at night, standing on top of bridges looking down. Just constantly flirting with death, but never quite embracing it.","I think for many people, suicide is that ‘emergency escape hatch’ on an airplane. You never are likely to use it, but it’s somehow comforting to know it exists. Whatever pain you are going through doesn’t have to be forever."

I was diagnosed with autism three years ago now, and have also had clinical depression and anxiety since a child. 

I have a kid of my own(almost 2 years old), and I'm a single parent. I work my butt off to keep them mentally and physically happy, while also having a stable home. 
I definitely wasn't ready to have a child, but was pressured by family to keep them. I love my kid and they've genuinely saved me from the suicidal thoughts I used to have, but I feel like it's not enough. The father is not in the picture as I broke up with him before finding out I was pregnant.

I don't do drugs or drink, I don't have friends, I've never been to a party before, and barely even finished High school because of my depression.

I'm not convenintially attractive, or smart, or anything special. And to add to everything, I've recently found out I'm a lesbian. 
I feel like I'm stuck and that I'll never be able to live my life properly or be able to find the love I've desperately craved for years. I cry nearly everyday because I feel like I've ruined my life and have no one to speak to.

I was diagnosed with autism three years ago now, and have also had clinical depression and anxiety since a child. 

I have a kid of my own(almost 2 years old), and I'm a single parent. I work my butt off to keep them mentally and physically happy, while also having a stable home. 
I definitely wasn't ready to have a child, but was pressured by family to keep them. I love my kid and they've genuinely saved me from the suicidal thoughts I used to have, but I feel like it's not enough. The father is not in the picture as I broke up with him before finding out I was pregnant.

","Just know that all of this doesn’t mean you ruined your life, it’s seems like your actually starting getting to know yourself more. As I got older and focused on my self more I learned fast who I actually am and when I first kinda learnt about myself my deppresion was worse then ever.

As I accepted myself more I becoming increasingly happier. By no means am I happy compared to the average male but I’m getting slowly happier and smarter.

Just know you haven’t “ruined your life” you be might starting a new life and becoming something you dreamed off being. That’s what helps me feel better and get through the day and keep learning about myself."

Just a thought, could you speak to a women's health organization/clinic in your area about supports and resources for young moms with depression? Also, do you have a family doctor or nurse practitioner who you could speak to?  


For what it's worth, I think it's helpful you realized you're gay - atleast you won't bother with guys and wonder why it doesn't feel good.

It’s hard when we expected so much from our life, sometimes in a way we can’t even articulate (maybe a sign it was never realistic) and we find our reality to be different. I think you’ll find yourself amongst many others who relate to their life not going how they planned. But I’ll also say that a couple of the most authentic, successful, happy people had this happen to them. The people who supposedly did it all correctly seem more unhappy to me. I think it’s because deep down we all know that if if we think we get what we want it won’t stay that way, we can’t keep it. The happiest people I’ve seen are the ones that learned to let go. That is very hard to do. If any of this resonates, perhaps consider looking into Thich Naht Hahn. I’m so sorry you’re struggling and I’m rooting for you."

my nose makes me depressed,"I'm 13F and I'm so hideous. people always tell me 'your just a kid and you'll look much more better when your 16 or in your 20s' but with my case its impossible. I've been called a monkey several times in terms of race and appearance, a man because I don't have a feminine face and I have a very deep voice that often confuses people. I'm extremely unlucky and I can't just change that suddenly. If I lose weight my big nose will be more prominent so there really isn't an option for me. My hair is also so bad since its relaxed but I don't take care of it because of personal reasons. The biggest issue is my nose and hair though. My nose doesn't and will never suit my face until I get nose surgery when I'm an adult or nose contouring. I'm reconsidering buying nose contour products to make my nose appear smaller but I'm not allowed to wear makeup until I'm 16 and I'll be in HUGE trouble if I get caught. However, 3 years is too long and I'm tired of being teased and being the ugliest girl in every area I'm in. I also want to make friends instead of scaring people(literally). A bunch of 6th graders asked me 'why do I look like that' and they just ran off. I'm a a 2/10, with nose contouring I'd be at least a 4.5/10",You're going to grow into your features. You're not done growing and you won't be for a while.
going to kill myself soon need reassurance ,I already have a plan and everything that i think will work. I just want someone to promise me that the other side is much better even if its a lie. I feel nervous yet relieved at the same time that I can finally move on thats all,Please don't die
I want to do it,"I survive this day to experience worse tomorrow. And it has been repeating lately. They say it gets better. But all they care about is to make us keep working.

It never gets better, it's a lie. I am in a worse mental state than ever before. I could try to do something to keep the thoughts away, just to realise I am a failure at it.

Failure in everything I could tell. I am surprised I can even write at this point. I am completely dumb and untalented. Only thing I had ever been good at is school performing.

But I have stopped caring about it. That learn to forget system demotivates me to do honestly anything. I didn't pass 2 things from my native language subject and the term is pretty close to ending while I have 2 presentations to make still from other subjects. 

Well, is it either my demotivation or I am just being lazy and spoiled to not appreciate what I am having. Probably yes. 

My best days is a past. Happiness is a past. I don't even remember being happy. I have found some old games I was playing as a little kid on a pc, when I began to play one I immediately started crying, as my memories get unlocked and I remember the good feelings which came from it, and I realise they will never come back again. 

It's just a joke that I am still living. I wanted to strangle myself few years ago but I was too weak to finish this. Now I'd wish to just get enough power for that last one thing. The only solution which is the only correct for me.

People, I don't want your advices, I don't want to go in some place and talk about this. I want eternal peace and this world guarantees nothing even similiar to it.

Please promise there isn't something like hell in afterlife. Few seconds of pain would prevent thousands of days of it happening. I am sure it's a threat from creators of society anyways. 

I really want to do it. Something keeps me away, but every day the part of it is getting destroyed and I am getting closer.  ","Ive heard that we can’t scientifically always be happy.  So we know that much.  Through my experience, I’ve also learned that I probably can’t achieve happiness as much as most people.  So I’ve started to try and change my perspective on what I want.  Like, fuck, why don’t I get really good at living my day to day without the expectation of being happy from everything I do.  I want to feel good about what I do, I want to feel rewarded.  If I can just make eye contact, communicate somewhat effectively, and do A and B, even while maintaining this perfect fucking robotic persona, I think I’ll take it.  I don’t need to make anyone laugh, and I don’t need to laugh.  But I need to do what I want to do, and I want to at least do it reasonably well.  I struggle going to work everyday because I don’t know how to have an effective conversation all the time, I don’t know how to casually laugh.  Then why am I trying to do that in the first place, or more importantly, why am I worrying about it?  One thing I want to start doing is working out again, and if I decide to wait until I’m happy, I might never work out another damn day in my life.  I don’t need to be happy to work out. I just need to be in the damn gym.  I just want to do the things that I actually want to do, because right now I’m not.  Your post resonated with me, and I’ve been trying to figure out what is gonna make me figure it out, and I think a part of that is going to cone down to stop expecting to be happy.  And I think this is step one.  We all seek that inner child, because that’s where happiness resides, from within ourselves.  I just know I’ll get some inner peace if I can just get back to living."

It´s sad tbh,"  
I understand the saying the world is so small but I think it's stupid because it's bigger than we can imagine. I could die tonight and 10 out of 8,000,000,000 people would know. Is it even worth going through all of this for nothing?  
  
  
  
","Hello.

For me, it's not sad or depressing, but oppressive and suffocating. I feel like im stuck in this universe, i want an another ""everything"", because i cant accept this one. What would you do if you desired to be in that empty space (we dont know whats there, of course.) in the ""outside"" of universe? You're obligated to exist in this tiny planet's reality, and you dont know whats going on there on the other, opposite side of the universe. I dont ""believe"" in extraterrestrial life; i accept this as a real knowledge, i ""know"" it. And, its a misfortune to be only in this planet. When we die, in my belief, there is a possibility of coming back to life again, but there is no possibility of coming back to this world again, because of the unimaginable massiveness of the universe.

You're completely unimportant here, just as everything and everyone. No one is important, and cannot be. Because, nothing is necessary, there is no any sufficient reason for existence. But im not writing this in a dark tone, or im not definitely insulting you; im just simply writing it, because nothing matters and thus, i dont care about anything. I cant understand why people are so keen on trying to be important, and feel like they're under attack when someone tells them something like ""you dont matter."" Being worthy and important are different things, and something worthy does not always have to be ""important""..

They always say that we come to this world only once, and thus, we should stop our pessimism and enjoy our temporary lives. But, nothing would have happened if ""we were coming to this world only once"". I mean, that would be a source of inaction (i dont say that inaction is a ""bad"" thing, i just simply say it. But, its sad when people automatically think that i mention inaction as a ""bad"" thing..). No one would think anything, no one would invent something, and thus, this language, this screen, these words would never exist. But yeah, that doesnt matter also..

Most people are unaware of those free spirits who smooths every mark made by their foot on the sand, who carefully destroys every footprint they leave while walking in places which no one visits, who makes every effort to avoid being discovered, being revaled. Being anonymous means freedom, too much freedom. ""No any"" celebrity is free, ""all of them"" are  bound by invisible chains. And, unfortunately, only a few can see these chains. The ordinary rest, insistently continues to envy these celebrities...

I just wanted to express myself, and how you interpret these is entirely up to yourself..."

Hate depressives slumps ,"I've been going to therapy, I just had back surgery that's making me feel better, I'm moving into cheaper living and most likely better as well, because of therapy I can understand that I'm not a burden to my friends or family if I ask for help (though the little voice always tries to speak up).

As the joke goes everything is looking up millhouse, but then I look at the one thing I truly can't do anything about.

Dating

Currently 24 and I don't even think I've held someone else's hand in a romantic way/setting. It's just upsetting that I've been working on myself as much as my mind will allow and actually been working but then I face the bigger beast and it just seems impossible, what can I do to make it better/easier? Am I just not meant for it? I wish I could at least be told that then teased with a possibility that seems out of reach.

And I know I could do better, I don't really socialize because of how I have felt about myself all this time, I just do what I want to do in the moment but then you get to sit down and think, would it have been better if someone was there with me? All my buddies are in relationships or even have kids and here I am wondering what a kiss feels like.

Soon I'll be finishing packing, be in a better mindset but right now I just hate this slump I'm in. And thank you if you read all of this.","\> As the joke goes everything is looking up millhouse

You'll be okay. Look it's a slump and the trick is to work out ways out of it - sometimes you can get there a day at a time, other times it needs something drastic.

\> I don't really socialize

I didn't until recently either and ... just by getting out of the house I've been meeting people. I'm married so nothing is going to happen with any of the women I've been speaking to (I'm way more comfortable with women than men) but I've been more than a little shocked to find that in some cases that I'm (53m) having to be the one doing the pushing away. BTW I've been really having to go way past my comfort zone in everything I do, lots of social risks, lots of embarrassing things ... seeing the humour in it all has been keeping me going through the roughest patch of depression I've ever had.

I think I might have actually made some friends as well! I might write a book about it one day (I might also have a touch of hypomania, oops)."

Drastic lifestyle change worked wonders for me, but I understand it won't work for everyone. Try everything you can before you give up, cause you never know. I thought it was truly the end until something worked. I was shocked. It sucks we have to pretty much fight for our happiness, but you might as well. You never know what may happen. If at the end you still feel that way, I understand for many nothing works at all. But first, try!"

Please…,"3 anti depressants, I'm sad to say, isn't a whole lot honestly. I was on 3 different ones by the age of 16, and more since then. For some, they find a combination of pills and/or therapy that works relatively quickly. For others, it's a TON of trial and error unfortunately. It's why mental health is so hard to treat because it's so vastly different for everyone. You'd be surprised how ridiculously long the list is for anti depressants, anxiety, anti psychotic, all of it. I'm sorry you haven't found anything yet, but don't give up. Try EVERYTHING before giving up. Cause one might work wonders! It's awful you have to suffer the duration, but there is still hope"

Many of us experience it and can have lasting effects well into childhood. Sometimes we don’t notice its impact until our life changes. For example I had a girl friend and was the first time being hugged and it hurt me so bad. Now it’s over and still searching for someone that can heal my heart. Which can only be done by us. Love you my friend.

Ruined my life,32 going on 33 and single. My life has been ruined and I’m struggling to come to terms with it. I need someone to talk to because it’s impossible to deal with these emotions.,"32 is young. You have time. You gotta throw away a lot of old habits and form new ones if you want to start again away from depression. I think you probably have an idea of what that means. 

For me, it's: exercise daily (this is non negotiable), taking supplements, getting good sleep, eating a healthy diet. Keeping my space clean. Not spending time with toxic people just for the sake of companionship. Joining social groups to gain community (this has been the biggest game changer). Becoming more spiritual (this is different for everyone but figure out what that means to you and start doing some reading). No drugs. Become open minded to who you CAN be and what life can be like. 

This is the way dude. You can do it. Again, 32 is young. You have time. You could be totally turned around a year from now. Start today."

Loss of friends,"I have a hard time when it comes to meeting people and considering them “friends”. I tend to surround myself with very controlling people. That is not a good thing for me because I refused to be controlled. 

I realized on Thanksgiving Day I was going to a place where one person who thought I was a friend was extremely controlling. I decided to decline the invitation because I had no desire to be around that kind of person anymore.

Have any of you struggled with this?",Currently going through this right now where all my friends are separating thensleves from me or just changing. I went from having maybe 5 friends to 2. It doesn’t seem like a lot but those connections took a lot of courage and time to build.  It hurts but eventually you will find true friends and realise who you should invest your energy into.
"CBT got rid of my low mood and rumination, but I still feel completely flat and apathetic. Have anti-depressants helped anyone in a similar state?","(In regard to rule 7, I'm only asking for anecdotal replies of whether anti-depressants helped others in a similar situation to me.)

I received CBT through my university in February and it continued until October this year. After 8 months of it, I genuinely have significantly reduced the time I spend ruminating and 'wallowing' in a depressive mood, I'm no longer tearful or quick to sadness and I'm not overly distracted my existential doubts or fears anymore. However, I'm absolutely flat. It's like I feel things but they have no friction, they don't stick. My emotions are so vague, there is no sense of urgency to any of my anxieties. I spend most days doing absolutely nothing, just waking up at 1pm and bingeing slop online while I have very important and urgent university work to do. I've been missing most of my lectures and have been doing every piece of mandatory work at the last possible second. I thought that because I'm not sad anymore that I'm cured, and that these were just persistent bad habits and laziness. But I'm starting to believe that I'm still depressed, because I am genuinely incapable of bringing myself to care about anything anymore. I'm still absolutely awful at personal hygiene, my sleep is still a complete mess, and I have absolutely no desire for literally anything. Sex doesn't interest me at all anymore, and social occasions no longer have any appeal. I have these underlying anxieties and stresses that I can feel physically affecting my body but they never breach the surface and they have literally no power in compelling me to action. It's a strange feeling that I'm sure you're probably familiar with yourselves. 

So I'm considering getting a doctors appointment for a prescription for SSRIs. But I've heard mixed opinions on them. I've heard that they can make you feel flat and apathetic on their own as well, but I've always heard that they do the exact opposite. I know that it's likely dependent on the individual but I don't want to risk exacerbating my slightly vegetative state right now as it's my last year of undergrad and things are really piling up at the moment. Has anyone been through a similar situation to this? Did anti-depressants help you with motivation at all? I'm really considering it because I'm tired of feeling powerless in my own body but I'm terrified of making things worse at a bad time to do so.","Lethargy and laziness are targeted by antidepressants. Sometimes they work and the person's energy increases, but other times they may not work or side effects may appear that lead to increased lethargy. The matter is very specialized, so you should discuss this with a doctor, not only take orders from him, but discuss with him and understand from him what the possible scenarios are and whether it is possible for him to give you stimulant medications if you continue to feel lethargic."
"I'm convinced my only way out is suicide, and I'm just playing a waiting game. ","This is my first reddit post, ever, so I'm not entirely sure what I'm even doing. I'm just miserable. I have been, for as long as I can remember. I've always had this feeling that life is just not meant for me, I'm not equipped to handle it, at all. I've felt this way since childhood. I'm alive primarily because I don't want to put my parents or my dog through that heartache, but, my parents are getting older and my dog won't be around forever either and once they're gone, I will officially have nothing. No reason to stay. Nobody that cares about me. Life will finally be completely and utterly meaningless. I'm 22, I still live with my mom, and I can't fathom living on my own. I am already overwhelmed and drowning in the stress of life, any additional responsibilities or things to worry about would surely send me over the edge. There is too much to worry about, too much to keep track of, everything is too expensive, working sucks, if you make any mistakes you could be fucked over severely, I can't afford anything, I don't know how to do so many vital things and I have nobody to show me or help me, I have no support system. I've been in therapy for over a decade now, I've tried various therapies, various coping skills, various medications, nothing makes it better.

I see so many people that have supportive, stable families, they have loving partners and friends, they're financially well off and they're figuring life out, and they have so much support that when these particularly horrible shitty confusing parts of life happen, they get through it. I wish I had that. I wish I could just be normal, not be consumed by depression all the damn time. 

I have fundamentally felt like I do not belong in this world ever since I was a kid. Like I just am not meant to be here, never was, and never will be. 

I can't change the inevitables in life. One day my parents will die. One day I will be alone, and the only people who truly unconditionally love and care about me will be gone. One day I will have no choice but to figure shit out, take on all these responsibilities I already know I can't handle and don't know how to navigate. I'm trying, I really am, I'm trying to prepare myself and figure things out while I do have some foundational stability, but I can't handle the stress. I'm so overwhelmed and it's only going to get worse so what's the point, really? I feel like once my dog and my parents are gone, my only choice will be to just take myself out with them. And that thought in itself is incredibly depressing. I'm just waiting to die, wishing I'd had the courage to get it done and over with when I was a teenager instead. I'm not glad I survived, I wish I was never born. I'm scared. And I don't know what to do.



 I don't want to die, the thought that my only true way to achieve peace is through dying is terrifying. But I also don't want to live. It's too hard. I don't have friends, or a big family I'm close to and that I can lean on. I'm too aware that life just really, really sucks. The good will never outweigh the bad. I'm always going to feel this way, because I always have felt this way. I am not meant to survive, and I can't just force myself through anyways. I have no purpose. I'm just here to suffer. I'm so unbelievably tired. ","you gonna figure it out. and you can change how you feel. you can achieve peace alive, all of us can do others did, you and me will do too."

This is an atypical way to phrase what I'm about to say so I apologise but stick by it please. My favourite movie is Citizen Kane, about a newspaper magnate who dies alone, miserable and unloved. One quote always stood out to me:

""That's all he ever wanted out of life... was love. That's the tragedy of Charles Foster Kane""

I relate to that a lot. I am obsessed with being admired. By everyone I meet. But I just feel I always fail. In the last three months a string of events has just seemed to confirm this. I became friends with a 32 year old art student who seemed to fulfill the admiration I sought. She started a relationship with me and used to always talk about me as her saviour and how beautiful and kind she thought I was and how she could never countenance leaving me. But I told her a couple of weeks ago I didn't feel I could talk to her anymore because I didn't think we could ever be together (she's also married with children). I also always felt like I was a bad friend because she struggled with depression and BPD and I'd always say I was here for her and here to support her but never felt I was doing anything to help. Then last week she was maligning me to my best friend. So it just makes me insecure about my impact on people if in the end after so many days all they do is hate me. I also think I have lost another close friend very recently and I don't even understand why. 

I am currently doing a degree in History and Politics at a university. I'm very interested in Chinese and African history, I'm also learning Chinese (though my language ability is threadbare). It sounds intensely narcissistic but at university I hoped if I could prove how intelligent and erudite I am I would have a coterie of admirers. But I know already that at least one person hates me. And I hadn't even ever spoken to them. So it makes me think there's something disgusting in myself that others sense. 

I have struggled with self esteem for a long time also because I have autism and always felt I was too weird to be acceptable to anyone. Last summer I was suicidal on a daily basis but never went through with it, only prepared it in rather loose terms. 

More than anything, I just feel alone. I just want to be admired and loved more than anything else. But where is this admiration I seek? It seems further away than ever. In the end, I have been around for nearly 2 decades. I have two friends. That is all. 

",Im here for you if you need to talk
Envy and jealousy,"I have only one person to talk to and this person now have ""more than a friend"" and a lot of friends.

I was extremely jealous at first that caused arguments between us. Now half a year later I'm not really jealous but envious so so much.

The solution would seem simple, but the problem is that I CANNOT talk to anyone. This is a problem that neither doctors nor I nor my parents have been able to solve since my teenage years. 

We are still friends, but I feel disgusted when I see how good she is with her friend (her friend is a girl).","Join some sub reddits you enjoy and speak to people on those and see how that feels.

Is this depression or am in illusion?,"Hi Reddit,  

I'm a 24-year-old from Ethiopia, and I’d like to share my story and seek your advice. I was a brilliant student during my primary and secondary school years, and while I did well in university, I didn’t perform as well as I could have.  

The turning point came in my teenage years when I started feeling deeply negative about myself. This self-hatred eroded my ability to focus on my education. A significant contributor to this is my family situation.  

My younger brother (20) has been battling epilepsy since he was 2. I was with him when he had his first seizure, and that memory still haunts me. We live in Africa, where access to proper medical care is limited, and my family can’t afford treatment for him. Watching him struggle has been devastating, not just for me but for my whole family.  

To make things harder, my father is struggling with alcohol addiction, and I’ve felt an overwhelming sense of responsibility to fix these issues. But as a student without a stable income, I feel powerless. This has taken a toll on my mental health.  

For the past 10 years, I’ve felt:  
- Constantly unfocused and unable to care for myself properly.  
- A deep sense of worthlessness and hopelessness.  
- Isolated and unwilling to talk to people.  
- Overwhelmed, with thoughts of giving up entirely.  

I’m wondering if this could be depression or if it’s something else entirely. I’d love to hear your thoughts or any advice you might have.  

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I’m looking for any help I can get.  

                           -----------------------------","It can be said that the diagnosis of depression is more descriptive than standard. Diagnosing mental disorders is not an easy thing. Even a student who finishes studying psychiatry needs years of experience and dealing with hundreds of patients before he is ready to make judgments freely and efficiently. It can be said that you have depression, or it can be said that you have post-traumatic stress disorder or anything else. What I want to say is that the diagnosis or descriptive condition is not as important as the symptoms and problems that the person faces. Depression is not the same for everyone. Each person has his own depression and each person has a slightly different way of dealing with his disorder. Your problem has a clear root that you can start from. You do not seem to be in a stable environment, and it will certainly affect your mental stability. Cognitive therapy may be suitable for you since you have a clear root for your problems. Also, do not be harsh with yourself. If you cannot afford cognitive therapy, you can download good self-help books online and read them."
Is this depression or am in illusion?,"Hi Reddit,  

I'm a 24-year-old from Ethiopia, and I’d like to share my story and seek your advice. I was a brilliant student during my primary and secondary school years, and while I did well in university, I didn’t perform as well as I could have.  

The turning point came in my teenage years when I started feeling deeply negative about myself. This self-hatred eroded my ability to focus on my education. A significant contributor to this is my family situation.  

My younger brother (20) has been battling epilepsy since he was 2. I was with him when he had his first seizure, and that memory still haunts me. We live in Africa, where access to proper medical care is limited, and my family can’t afford treatment for him. Watching him struggle has been devastating, not just for me but for my whole family.  

To make things harder, my father is struggling with alcohol addiction, and I’ve felt an overwhelming sense of responsibility to fix these issues. But as a student without a stable income, I feel powerless. This has taken a toll on my mental health.  

For the past 10 years, I’ve felt:  
- Constantly unfocused and unable to care for myself properly.  
- A deep sense of worthlessness and hopelessness.  
- Isolated and unwilling to talk to people.  
- Overwhelmed, with thoughts of giving up entirely.  

I’m wondering if this could be depression or if it’s something else entirely. I’d love to hear your thoughts or any advice you might have.

31M and I'm sure I'm going to die alone,"I'm 31M, virgin and I'm absolutely sure I'm going to die alone. I've never been in a relationship. I've never had anyone to truly be myself with, someone who makes me want to be better then I am, someone who can hold me when life is overwhelming. And its honestly beginning to hurt to much. The only thing that keeps me going these days is so that my mom doesn't have to sit at my funeral wondering where she went wrong. So that I don't just one day never log in again for my one actual friend. 

I don't want to be alone anymore. Its so goddamn hard to go to work and hear people talk about their wife or girlfriend. Its hard to go online and see a couple with ""I'm Hers"" or ""I'm His"" in their bios in VRChat. Hell, just seeing people hold each other makes me want to just curl up and die. 

Fuck I'm tired.","Hell, I'm in the same boat. Just turned 31 and I've always been single. Part of me feels happy for anyone successful in finding love. But yeah, I can't help walking around and feeling like shit anyway when I see those same people happily married with their own kids. I have basically everything I could want. A home, car, college degree, respectable career, financial stability, muscular build (I work out a ton), and I have friends. But for the life of me, I can't find a partner. It just hurts. I'm happy with myself on a personal, individual level, but I guess what stings more than anything is knowing I probably won't have anyone to share that with. Modern dating is just awful."

Fuck I'm tired.",I know how you feel. For some reason I am past this feeling. Sometimes it still gets me but when I start looking at other relationships then they don't seem perfect. Some people stay together and don't love each other anymore. There are so many variations of what could go wrong or isn't as perfect as you might think. So being in a relationship does not always mean something positive... it can be torture too. When looking at statistics in the west divorces are at 40%. 10% should probably break up but don't...so 50/50. Of course feeling loved is important but it can also fall apart. People just don't want to show or talk about that...

Fuck I'm tired.",I think you forgot that you're a guy.. there's no clock time for you to be in a hurry. 31 is not that old.. it's better to enjoy your singularity and do the things that you love rather than compare yourself.. as for now love yourself and the people that are giving you love. Appreciate what you have and work on improving yourself more and making your time worth it. In a relationship status is not all fun. At times not having someone maybe is lonely.. but it only happens when you're not occupied with something that gives an added meaning to your life. I'm not saying stay single.. maybe give time to social life and presently work on making yourself a boyfriend or husband material. They say.. don't go and search for what you want.. do something that attracts it. May you find your source of joy in this world we pass by. And hopefully have someone special to share your days with sooner. Be grateful for the things and people you have in your life now.. a good mindset is a good start.

How to let go of Guilt/Shame,"Hey guys, I often live in the past in my head about past relationships and wonder how you guys have dealt with guilt and shame? It seems like I’ve made peace but it comes back in waves, how do you guys deal with this?","The guilt of something I did when I was 14 will eat away at me until the day I die, simply because I can't take back what I did - but what I can do is acknowledge how I made the person I hurt feel, and resolve never to repeat what I did again, and the God's honest truth is I never have.

That has helped somewhat, knowing I'm a genuinely different and changed person from what I was way back when (I'm 31 now), but what I did still haunts me, because who I am is not what I did, and what I did is not who I am. I just wish I could tell my emotions that, because I think my emotions instead of feeling them, which I wouldn't recommend to *anyone*. I'm working on it!

The only way for me that I'd ever be able to let go of the guilt I feel is if a time machine was invented."
How to let go of Guilt/Shame,"Hey guys, I often live in the past in my head about past relationships and wonder how you guys have dealt with guilt and shame? It seems like I’ve made peace but it comes back in waves, how do you guys deal with this?",I struggle with it massively. I take meds and sleep ok but sometimes lie there and criticize myself for hours. It sucks. I recently changed jobs so I hope that helps. Good luck
How to let go of Guilt/Shame,"Hey guys, I often live in the past in my head about past relationships and wonder how you guys have dealt with guilt and shame? It seems like I’ve made peace but it comes back in waves, how do you guys deal with this?","Oooof so tough!! Feeling you. I struggle here too. I journal with that version of me, like I pretend to be a wise adult therapist “self” and then journal back and forth with that part, say my carnal angry teen. Just back and forth like a conversation.. I usually always unearth some deep wound from which I was operating. I try to love that wounded part. Figure out what she really needed when she caused that harm. Make amends if it feels appropriate.

And yea, once or twice doesn’t do it, **unfortunately** different things in life reveal different shames and guilts I’m holding so it comes in waves. Not linear by any means 🌀"
How to let go of Guilt/Shame,"Hey guys, I often live in the past in my head about past relationships and wonder how you guys have dealt with guilt and shame? It seems like I’ve made peace but it comes back in waves, how do you guys deal with this?",Therapy is good for this in helping us to look at the narratives we tell ourselves. I still have guilt/shame for things that were done to me but I've been able to cut myself some slack these days in realising that I was a severely messed up kid and that I don't have to be a messed up adult because of it. For the most part it's other people who should be carrying the shame that I've carried for so long.
How to let go of Guilt/Shame,"Hey guys, I often live in the past in my head about past relationships and wonder how you guys have dealt with guilt and shame? It seems like I’ve made peace but it comes back in waves, how do you guys deal with this?","That’s such a great thing that you can look back on your past and know that you’re a different person! I try to keep my mind occupied and live in the present. There’s a quote I have to remind myself often, “if you think in the past about regret or something you could have done differently, or look into the future about shoulda coulda wouldas, you’re pissing on today”. I need to journal more!"

I end up journaling with wisdom and good advice, but never look back to the entries that really matter. There’s one entry that I wrote to the old version of myself and it’s really good! It’s about loving myself and having compassion and I should read it everyday. I only read it when I’m at my breaking point lol"
How to let go of Guilt/Shame,"Hey guys, I often live in the past in my head about past relationships and wonder how you guys have dealt with guilt and shame?

I’m in therapy as Weil I just lose focus from journaling which helps ALOT. I’m also in therapy twice a week
How to let go of Guilt/Shame,"Hey guys, I often live in the past in my head about past relationships and wonder how you guys have dealt with guilt and shame? It seems like I’ve made peace but it comes back in waves, how do you guys deal with this?","I can look back on my past and recognize that I'm a different person - but I'm not foolish enough to pretend that the person I hurt *wasn't* hurt by what I did. They were. I just don't understand why I can't recognize that emotionally.

I just can't seem to get my emotions out, no matter how hard I try. I feel completely empty inside, and when I look back on what I did, I don't feel happiness, sadness, anything... just nothing. I am completely shut down emotionally. My brain, however, says differently. It tells me that what I did was wrong, and when I ask myself if I plan on repeating what I did, the answer is and has always been a very firm no. I shouldn't have done what I did, and don't ever want to repeat it - and I can honestly say l never have, and never will again.

I wish I could feel my emotions, because it's so frustrating knowing that what I did was wrong, recognizing that and knowing I'll never do it again, but also knowing I hurt someone and just not being able to outwardly express it. I either feel like a fraud or like I'm watching my past as though it's starring someone else. It's the weirdest feeling in the world. Like I said, I wouldn't recommend thinking your emotions. Feeling them is something I desperately want to do, and I hope one day I'll be able to."
Treated like shit by everyone ,"I hate my life. Every aspect of it. Every physical trait, my genetics, my personality, family, etc. Everything that makes me, me. No one respects me.

16f - depression has made me a boring person with no hobbies or skills ,"I don’t do any sports, play any instruments, I’m not particularly good at anything.

Girl, same.

Even despite my depression and suicidal attempts in my younger years, Ive always bounced back in some way shape or form after some downtime.

But since last year, when my brother unalived himself, and fought with my family.... I have no desire for anything. No desire to see anyone or get close to anyone.

I have custody of my nephew. He's depressed too, I'm spending a lot of time trying to help him with his depression. It's hard. F*ck depression."

I just wanna say first that at 16 you're very young and have lots of years to figure things out and find your place. At this age people are often much less stable and more prone to feelings of disaster when things don't go as one had hoped. But trust me, you have plenty of time and there will be lots of opportunities for you. You just need to get started, and you could start out small with doing things at home that require effort.

When we become less active, our energy levels tend to go down and everything can seem harder to do. If we start being more active, energy levels tend to go up. For example, I (and others I spoke to) found that exercise like running makes everything feel easier once you've gotten into the habit of it, because it's tough while you do it, and so your body and mind get used to dealing with uncomfortableness.

I would suggest you make a list of a few things you would like to try, and then write down the pros and cons for each one.

For example you could try to learn to cook a new dish at home. Good, tasty and nutritious food (I suggest something with some vegetables in it) can help with energy levels and be a motivation for pushing through things that are tough, like going to the gym or some other demanding task.  
Healthy food can also help against symptoms from ADHD.

If you are a kind and trustworthy person, then there will be people who want you as their friend, and again you have lots of time to find your place and figure out what you wanna do with your time. You just need to get started with what you can muster now and then build on gradually from there.  
You could maybe take 20 or 30 minutes every day where you focus on figuring out what you wanna start with.

I hope this helps"

You say you’ve been depressed your entire childhood which coincides with when you quite ballet. Maybe try finding activities that make you happy.

What is the use of life anymore?","You know, I think money is the root of nearly all of the evil that happens in the world. I'm not saying if you earn a lot of money your a bad person, far from it.

Regardless, look for people who don't want anything from you but to get to know you. These days it seems pretty hard to locate these guys through the fog of gold diggers, fake people, manipulators etc.

""What is the use of life anymore?"", You're a human being, If a ""friend"" can't see that then they aren't a real friend. Money isn't everything. You can't take it to the grave therefore it holds limited value, but you can take the love that you gave out to other people to the grave. Worldly materials hold a bound, not love though.

To find people that truly like you for you and not for any fabricated purpose is difficult you could try some social groups or generally do the stuff you enjoy and you'll be sure to find real friends.

Get away from these ""friends"" that want money from you, they're not real ones."

","The rap is good not going to lie. I want to give you a fact though NPD or Narcissistic personality disorder isn't common,  only 1-6% of people have it.

I ain't a trained professional, nor did I study this. The word narcissistic gets thrown around way too much. It's decently uncommon.

Miscarriage and loss of pets and long depression,"I miscarried in October 2018, the father was supportive though we were on and off until 2020. I lost one cat in November 2020, lost another cat in December 2020. My dating life ended that year. 

I got a puppy in 2021 and he keeps me grounded and busy. I cherish every moments we have. I focus on him so much though, I haven't put much work into myself

It's a tough time of the year for death anniversaries. To top it off, the father of my unborn child came back into my life a few months ago, just so that he could broke things off yesterday because he started dating another person...
I'm still recovering after all these years and still not ready to be in a relationship. I was sad, mad, and also relieved that he ended it. I feel like I have nothing to offer at this time and I want to just focus on myself. Though I am disappointed because I thought he was a better person.

I can't seem to go back to my old self prior to these deaths... I'm in a better place compared to the first few years... but I don't know if/when I will recover.  ","My goodness - You are grieving the loss of a child, a relationship and your two kitty companions. Each love loss added to the grief burden you were already carrying. Grief depression is real, and it hits everyone differently. 

Me, I mourned my infertility and divorce for 8 years. Meanwhile I was functioning and people thought things were ok so they tried to fix me up with hilariously bad results. 🤡 I went to multiple grief support groups over the years and slowly things got better for me. One thing that was really helpful that they suggested in group was setting aside extended time for deep mourning. 

Over a long weekend, I pulled out every card and letter and stupid gift from my ex, read it and screamed and destroyed it.  I wrote down all of my hateful thoughts towards him and burned them. And I wrote letters to the children I’d never had, and let myself grieve not getting to be a mom. I cried and yelled … a lot. 

Somehow pulling the scabs off the wounds let me start to heal, and not long after that I started dating the man who became my second husband, the love of my life. 

Please take the time to allow yourself to honor the hurt you’ve experienced. If you can, find a grief group (churches usually run them but you don’t have to belong or believe, there were Muslims, atheists, Jews and Christians in my groups.) if your job offers mental health benefits, please use them too. It does get better. You deserve to focus on your self and maybe bonding with your doggo  on long walks and play sessions can help too. ❤️‍🩹"
"I am tired, I just want to rest","I can't keep living like that, I am so tired, I want to sleep and never wake up. I have been trying so much, I have been doing therapy for so many years, I have been exercising, trying to socialize; I thought wouldn't continue to feel that pain, but I now I see that nothing will ever change. I am alone all the time, my life has no value, I cry all the time, I never feel happy, I don't want to.live like that. My family don't understand me, when I try to talk about what I am feeling they don't take it seriously or just say for me to grow up.

Is depression a valid reason to struggle with getting things done?,"
I deal with both depression and anxiety, and while I manage them, I still get overwhelmed, especially when faced with difficult tasks. I know it might sound like something everyone goes through, but for me, it’s much worse. It’s this overwhelming sense of fear and anxiety that I can’t fully describe. I distract myself to avoid the task but when i do, I’m not necessarily stuck in bed; I still go out and act normal, even though inside I feel like sh!t because I know i have to do the task at hand.

This led to me missing a deadline, and while I take full responsibility , I’m trying to explain to my family that it wasn’t intentional and I genuinely struggle with this. They think I’m using it as a “crutch,” but I’m not. It’s hard to explain a feeling you can’t fully put into words, and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. I hate that I go through this.

The fact that I’m able to go out and do things  for fun makes me feel like it invalidates my struggle. If I can’t bring myself to do things I don’t enjoy, does that mean I’m just lazy? 
I don’t think I’m lazy because the sense of overwhelm is something serious, but I’m trying to see things fairly. At the same time, my mind makes me feel like I am lazy because of this. 

I don’t know, it’s hard to explain but what do you guys think?? 





","First of all, as someone who has experienced debilitating depression I get how difficult it can be to do simple things.  But this scenario seems more like a mindset, or perspective issue.  Some call it the all or nothing thinking I believe.  If I can’t have fun I’m not doing it.  Right, because when I’m in my depressed episodes, I struggle to even do those things that I actually enjoy as well.  And maybe in your case, that’s where this leads, I don’t know that for sure.  But if you keep allowing yourself to say no to the things you don’t want to do because of depression, will you eventually start saying no to the things you do want to do, because of depression?  You see what I mean?  I’m simply making a suggestion to push yourself to get through those moments, before you really start reinforcing your brain that it’s okay to not do things because of my current mood.  Better to start reinforcing the action based habits, than non-action based habits.  That’s also an older version of me talking to a younger version of me, as well."
Having the worst time of my life,"

I don’t think anyone’s having as bad of a time as I am right now. First, I found out my boyfriend has a WIFE  Like, how could I be so dumb? We were together for a year, and I didn’t figure it out. There were signs, but I was too naive to notice—he was my first ever boyfriend.  

I have no one else apart from him. I’m an introvert who can’t make friends and doesn’t have family nearby. He was my whole world, and now I just feel so stupid.  

And as if that wasn’t enough, I’m also having immigration issues, and because of that, my workplace isn’t paying me. I don’t even have any savings because I poured everything I had into my school fees.  

I don’t know how I’m supposed to keep going. It feels like everything is falling apart all at once.  

 ",I lowkey went through the same thing with my ex girlfriend but you know what I’m happy she’s out my life for good because I was feeling like this relationship is going nowhere fast

You definitely sound depressed and surrounded by toxic people including your boyfriend. You’re not going to be happy while in a miserable relationship. Depressed or not, no one would be. 

Is less contact with your family possible?

I turned 27 last week, and honestly, it just felt like another reminder of how everyone in my life makes me feel like I’m not enough. I don’t enjoy anything I used to love anymore. I don’t even have the energy to make new friends or find a better boyfriend. Living feels exhausting, and I just want to disappear for a while.

I've had less screen time for a few months now (I uninstalled the apps that were wasting my time), however I have the same idea that the damage is done and my capacity has decreased.

Edit: i'm 26M, i also believe i wasted my last two or three years by making so many bad decisions. i dunno what to do too, suicidal thoughts keep rushing in my mind everytime im not distracted by screen/video games..."

I spent months doing nothing. Didn’t even comment much on reddit, drive or play video games. Nothing to keep my brain stimulated or concentrated on one thing. I became so insecure that I was ashamed to engage in any of those things, despite the fact I was doing something much worse (sleeping all day and wallowing in self pity).

Extreme Brain Fog,"My cognition is non existent. My coordination is horrible. I can’t focus on anything. Forget things mere seconds after. Genuinely can’t type properly on my phone nor on a pc. Range of vocabulary has shrunk 100 fold over the past year. Head is constantly aching with pain. I can barely socialise. The only reason I’m able to survive is due to living in a large household with my family. I’ve cut down my screen time but I fear the damage has already been done. I feel like whilst I was living in ignorance, I was completely fine. Once I’d become aware of how I was living prior (a bum basically), i feel like my brain just went into hibernation mode to cope with reality.

Has anyone else ever experienced this? My internship so far I’ve done practically no work because I can’t focus, remember or learn anything. My punctuation is horrible now. I genuinely can’t function in society and it’s demoralising. I can’t drive anymore. I’m like a toddler in adult form. Even in my thoughts I’m saying the exact opposite of what I’m meant to say. 

It’s getting harder and harder to carry on knowing that my brain’s absolutely cooked. I can’t carry out basic functions of being an adult. I can’t even watch movies or shows. Where do I go from here?
I wasted my last two years of life. I’m still in the same position I was in when I graduated high school. ","Yup. Only reason I’m even still alive is thanks to my poor parents taking care of me (had to move back in cause my life was a shambles at that point). One part of me thinks that it’s due to the excessive screen time, but I did the same last year and had no problems cognitively. I think it’s a combination of things. Being at home 24/7 wallowing in my own self loathing perhaps made me brain dead. My brain couldn’t cope with the intense negativity and went into hibernation. I can’t even work a minimum wage job at this rate, I simply can’t function."
I am unworthy,"I don't deserve happiness. I've done terrible things in life. I don't know anyone worse than me. I slashed at my leg in a fit of rage yesterday. I hate myself. And I shouldn't be sad, because I do have a great life. I have lots of friends and family, who love me. But I still hate myself. Moreover, I have no one to talk to. So, so many people depend on me. I have to be there for others. I don't know what to do now, but I do know how this ends - a rope and a chair. ","Please do not end your life, even if you think people might want you to and stuff (sometimes I feel like people want me to end it all).

Just like everyone else in this world you deserve happiness to, just because you make mistakes in life doesn’t mean you are warranted or deserve to hurt yourself. I guarantee that you haven’t done worse things then I have I’ve also done unspeakable things in life that also made me want to end it all but I realised everyone’s made mistakes in life and that doesn’t mean that it’s worthy to end it.

I hope you know that I totally relate to you, just like a lot of us we have been there to and it’s so hard, not to Demise what you’ve been through although I don’t know you I can say I know exactly what your talking about. there’s been weeks even months were I couldn’t get out of bed. But I got through and it did end up being a light out of that tunnel. 

If you take anything from this, there is a light at the end of that tunnel no matter how dark and how hard it is to see….. it’s there.

Also, be kind to yourself it’s hard living sometimes but nothing is ever worth ending your life."

You of all people should understand yourself and stand by your side. you should depend on yourself, trust me when I say this nobody can be a better best friend than yourself, love yourself the way you are. Good or bad it's for others to judge not you. You should never judge yourself , NEVER. At least you've acknowledged your mistakes you are a better person than many others who do far far worse and still don't acknowledge it .

my mind feels broken sometimes,"You know, the one thing that sounds great to me is to cut loose everything in my life and go live inside a cabin in the woods. It seems it would be so tranquil there without any one to seek validation from or caring what they think. To give into the desire to become a recluse is a comforting yet painful idea. I hate my brain. I hate social media and the internet. I hate modern society. People are fine, but I don't understand why I seek validation from them so much. CBD oil helps somewhat but these thoughts still exist. I'm so lonely. It is absolutely agonizing to have no-one close enough and not have any motivation to change that. I'm in college and it feels like everyone has extremely active social lives and exist with ease, but everyone has their set of problems. My mind doesn't allow this thought process to exist emotionally. I go to parties then leave immediately due to my sheer awkwardness and anxiety.

Shit, my thoughts are so chaotic and harmful. Why can't my brain just shut the fuck up and leave my emotions stable? Why must I envy others when that just dampens my own motivation?

I feel like the above stream-of-consciousness reflects my thought patterns. I constantly think about what others think of me and then question the social interactions I had with them as well as my own life choices. There is nothing like trying to relax and then that is undermined by things like ""I need to stop spending so much"" or some other anxiety.","Damn I read this and was like wait I don’t remember posting this, that’s how much this resonated with me… you’re definitely not alone with these thoughts!!!"

You know the saying ""The cake is a lie""? It's the same with friendships. Your best friend should always be you, so, don't blame yourself for any failed relationships. It's okay not to love everyone, and it's okay if someone doesn't like you. You're not incomplete or you're not enough because of that. Any relationship takes time, effort and a lot of energy for both sides (also money, lol). And friendship shouldn't feel forced, it should feel natural. So, I guess, sometimes it's better to have zero friends, than to have some fake ones. 
All I want to say is, you're beautiful the way you are, and I'm sure you're perfectly fine, stranger. There are plenty of fish in the sea, don't judge yourself based on the ones that surround you. 
P. S. I hope you've rewarded yourself with a treat 😁🍡🍨🧁🍦🍫🍬🍭"

Do you have a passion or hobby? Maybe a book club, for example?

The world(work, school, ppl in the wild) don't and won't care that it's my birthday. the river keeps flowing. out of the 8 billion ppl in the world, what makes my birth so worth celebrating? I feel too worthless/insignificant to be celebrated. what can I do to feel more worthy? so I went out, and committed acts of kindness to raise my self worth. ""now I feel like a good person"" regardless of whether or not I have ppl telling me. I know I've been a positive part of the world. Also, I'd rather be lowkey than be one of those ppl out there raving that ""it's my special day"" while acting like entitled egotistical brats making everyone else's life miserable while they get ""exactly what they want"" for some inflated sense of self-importance.

I got incredibly close to that with my partner recently and I don’t regret it because she’s still here. I saw your comment that said your relationship is closeted and I’m guessing that could have something to do with her parents and her not having a relationship. I’m incredibly sorry for that, I hope it changes and you get the support and love you both deserve. Any additional contacts for her support system that you can gather would be helpful too, I keep my partners family number saved and it’s usually the first thing on my mind when she starts to spiral."

period,"got my period after months and i cant even bother to wear a pad. told myself that its not heavy and is only staining my cloths and not anywhere so its okay. I feel unreal and gross, like im still not getting up to wear one even after reflecting","Not keeping up with ADL’s (activities of daily living) of which this would be along with showering, brushing teeth, eating, etc, is a hallmark of depression. Would you be able to set one goal for yourself today and give this some attention? Do you have anyone that could help you if needed?

Some people don’t understand how rough it is to even shower with depression. I’ve been there. Yes, we know we need a shower but feel like we’re in cement. Are you working with any type of doctor or therapist? I hope you feel better soon."

It's the same as not having the energy to shower, or brush your teeth. I'm sorry you're feeling that way. If you have a bathtub, maybe just go sit in there awhile. You'll get yourself cleaner and probably feel a bit better at least. As hard as it can be to do these things, it always does feel better afterwards"
super burn out lately ,"so what do i need to do, to go back to my old self it’s been 4weeks idk what’s the cause or is it the impact of the movie i recently watch? can that happened i don’t know what’s happening 😭","Slowly but surely making changes. That’s what helps

So forcing yourself out the house
Forcing yourself to think positively

Look at the sky and find beauty in it
Find beauty in everything you do

Take some chill time
Do some activities, this is important too. Exercise!

Good luck!! You got this"
I feel like such a failure in life. I don't even have the will to live.,"I'm 18M and I feel like I am wasting my life. I literally do nothing everyday... I wake up and do nothing except doom scrolling on my phone. It doesn't even feel good but I still can't stop. I also have PMO addiction, it doesn't even feel good but I still do it anyway. Recently I also discovered gambling and then I lost all my money and now I am absolutely broke and have no money to even buy lunch at school. I literally wake up, scroll on my phone, jerk off and feel bad about it before going to bed but still repeat the same cycle tomorrow. I also regret losing all the money I had saved due to gambling. It's not a lot but it was a significant amount to me.


I also feel very insecure about myself because I am literally good at nothing. I see many of my friends and they are good at something like a particular sport or studies etc. Meanwhile I am literally good at nothing and I don't think I have any useful skills or hobbies. I really wanna get things done but I end up procrastinating and never do them. Honestly I kinda feel insecure and jealous seeing other people's success.

I also recently got rejected by a girl I liked and honestly I can't blame her. Because I'm literally worthless so I don't see why she would choose a guy like me. She clearly deserves better.

And it's not just that... I feel like I am constantly failing my parents and letting them down. They have high expectations from me but I keep letting them down. I was not like this when I was younger. I used to be a good kid. But now I am literally not studying at all and failing in my exams. Also I have the most important exam of my life next year. Still I am not studying and if I don't my life is probably gonna be ruined. And honestly it hurts because my dad is spending a lot of money on my education. My parents are providing me with everything I need and I am very grateful to them but still I can't get the only thing done which they expect from me. They just want me to do good in school. Yet I don't even study for a minute. I can't even concentrate and I think I might have ADHD.

I'm sorry if all of this was too long. I just needed to get this off my chest. Honestly these days I don't even have the will to live. I feel so depressed for no reason all day. The only time I feel happy is ig when I am with my friends. But still I can't share everything with them. I just feel ashamed and I don't wanna burden them with all my problems. So I thought I would just let it all out here.","While its good to always strive for more, you have to remember that you are worthwhile just being you. Outside factors doesn't change this unconditional value you have as your own person.


You are also good at being empathic to others woth how you don't want to let them down. Thats a genuine good quality that you miss just because you put yourself down in the process.

So try to remember, that you are worthwhile unconditionally. Deal?"
my mind  is sleeping away ,"by this i mean, experiencing memory issues mental fatigue, can’t think straight ?. i genuinely think my mind’s deteriorating i hardly remember basic things i feel like time passes by and i’m not really “living in the moment” it’s hard to explain like i’m not experiencing anything everything’s just passing by? i stay up everyday and have never slept before 12 am the past year so that might be why but it’s so tiring. my cognitive function is horrible i feel dumber than ever i’ve always felt dumb but now i feel very stupid i feel like i take things literal now when someone jokes me with me and i used to understand sarcasm now i don’t? i cant form proper sentences without making any sense either i make a lot of grammatical mistakes too. what is going on in my head i feel like i’m losing brain cells day by day it’s hard to even describe how i’m feeling or put it into words 
edit: i meant slipping away in the title ",Yep that’s depression brother or sister please don’t give up
I was feeling a depressed but now I am happy ,All people who have feeling better now please comment how you recovered ,Time and finding consistency which offered hope for the future. Granted I’m nowhere out of feeling sad but it’s much better now.
"I have so many friends,","But none of them feel real. We we're not made for this we we're not made to stare through a screen.

more than 100 friends, I'm supposed to be happy but I'm just not because nobody cares for me, except me.","Right now, im writing to you, without knowing your name, without knowing what kind of person you are, without knowing your real face. I can never feel ""at home"" in this dark, lonely place, because the only thing that ""welcomes"" me are those colorless, odorless, lifeless, and more than that, insincere, fake, disguised words. But these words cant explain anything, all of them are insufficient. I mean, no one can do anything impactful to others only from that screen. I think, no one knows no one. Yet, everyone acts like they know everyone.

I just wanted to express myself, and how you interpret these is entirely up to yourself..."

There no point to living if I can’t be beautiful,"I always look back on my most traumatic moments and think to myself “it wouldn’t be as bad if I was beautiful”. I always think that sure I was raped a lot but it wouldn’t have been so bad for me if I was attractive, if there’s something I could change about my life it would definitely be my face and body and not my childhood. 

I hope I’m not the only person that feels this way, I don’t think there’s a reason to live if I can’t be beautiful. Beautiful people usually have so much more, I’m not saying they don’t struggle but I just wish I had at least that instead of having every single aspect of me be absolutely hideous.

I try working on myself but the more I realize that I’m faulty and broken the more I come to terms with the fact that I’m useless. I’m disabled, mentally ill and ugly meaning I couldn’t work even if I wanted to, I can’t even go to school anymore!!

I might seem weird for this but I see stories of models getting abused verbally and sexually and I think “Well at least you’re pretty and making money off of it” I know it’s fucked up but I don’t know why I think that way and I want it to stop. I just have so many disgusting thoughts about it like “At least you’re making money from it” and I know I shouldn’t think it but I feel extremely envious.

i’ve developed a shopping addiction since i’ve been diagnosed with depression ,"i had undiagnosed depression for a few years and got formally diagnosed almost a year ago. i was taking medication to help me cope with this on top of a mound of other social and financial problems i was dealing with, but i abruptly stopped due to not having contact info for my provider since they left (this was at my university). i’ve gone to therapy but haven’t had the best experiences so i also stopped abruptly. since then, my shopping addiction has worsened to the point where i always have a list of things to buy. I’m on a tight budget already so i know i shouldn’t spend as much as i am, but it’s genuinely the only the that makes me happy. i’ve spent thousands of dollars on clothes and makeup just to keep me alive since it’s the only thing i look forward to. 

i would really appreciate any advice.",The best advice is to make it harder for your to spend. Depending on how bad you go down the rabbit hole requires safe guards. Also you must ask why do we need these things. Don’t worry I understand and struggle like crazy…

"Got an good advice today i know prejudices are bad, but don't always see the bad in people ",.,"I think we often think of people as ""others"" rather than as individuals. This is especially true for depressed people as we envy the life that isn't ours, which is ""everyone elses"".

But if we take a step back and realise that every person is an individual, someone with heavy burdens and lighter moments of happiness, we can realise that there is good even in the bad. 


I like to think back on a quote from my favourite manga (I had that same dream again, big recommendation for anyone lurking this subreddit) ""We are all different, but the same""."
21M I only want one thing,I just want to feel loved by someone. To come back home after a long day and tell them about my highs and lows. Someone who truly gets what I’m going through. I would love to have a girl I can hold to make them feel safe. I would do anything to have all of this but here I am stuck and alone.

Failing studies because I have little hope for the future. The few 'friends' I have are not even worth a penny. Changed the university to find some friends/a gf, in vain. Can't get up from bed till it's like 10am on day offs, dis so true... Don't know what to do anymore...   
I had a crush on my 'best' friend before, it was the best time of my life, almost had it. Anyway, sad story. I know doing it again will turn my life around. It's mindboggling to me how people around us tell us that being single is better.  
  
Now 2 years on dating apps, nothing. Even though I'm just the most ordinary guy there can be, nothing weird like most people there💀 (+I don't smoke nor drink, so a big W). What's weird is that there literally wasn't even a single depressed girl there. What are they doing if not looking for some hope?... The few rest either rejected me or were afk."

But you still have a lot of time to get back on track! Get in shape, improve your skills, self confidence first.   
I made the mistake of trusting others too much. So don't make my mistake. Follow your passions, find someone who shares  your interests and be happy. It may sound selfish, but the world rn is messed up and oftrn all you need is just one shoulder."

Never been able to get a girlfriend or date. 0 matches on dating apps for 10 years. Really all I want to know is what a hug from someone who cares about me feels like. I'm not going to sit here and say I know what your going through. We all go through different challenges and react to them differently. What I can do is recommendations. Therapy is one option. I personally find motivation videos help me a lot. Find ones that fit best for you and listen to them on your commute, will prepping meals, or will exercising. I have started exercising more because of them. Another thing is finding a hobby. I find sitting at by the river drawing or reading helps me a lot. You don't have to be good at drawing. I will sometimes just keep drawing the same shape at different sizes and angles to create patterns. If I need to let out frustration I skip rocks in the river or go for a jog through the park. If it feels like you don't have time I recommend creating a schedule it helps a lot. That way you can see when you work, and plan on doing things. It makes it a lot easier to find time. I work Monday - Friday, 8:00 - 18:00. I hope some of this helps. Take care of yourself, love yourself, and I hope you find the happiness you deserve."

40 is a good number ,"This is my first time posting here. I've been coming here just to read and find connection.

I'm 39 male from Arizona and I've been dealing with depression for sometime now. Im in therapy right now going every week. Im on medication and I don't think it's really working.
Im a father of 3 and have a GF of 9 years. People would say I have a great life but mentally and emotionally I'm alone.
If you get it then you get it. When I say I feel alone, it feels like I'm uncomfortable in my own body and feel small.
I had a great childhood, my parents have been married for 45 years. I have an older brother and sister. Somewhere along the way I would say in my 20's I started to feel depressed.

The only person I share everything with is with my therapist. I feel like she understands or maybe she has to cause it's a business.

This whole mental awareness month is a bunch of bullshit and a way for people just to post on social media for the likes.
Do people really care when they ask -""hey how are you doing?""

I normally just say good so they can move on. Because in reality im not good and im struggling but no one really wants to hear that.

Fathers day last year, the week of, I was going to kill myself. I was right where I was going to do it and had my gun in my hand.
What stopped me was a car pulled up a few spaces down and the passenger looked right at me and just waved.

So this brings me the present day. I guess from a test I took in severely depressed.
I’ve made my decision and I’m finding peace with it. 
I am mentally tired and exhausted. 

My kids are wonderful and I hope none of them feel like this ever.

I don't want sympathy. Im
Not looking for ""everyone loves you"".

Im good with my decision.
Im going to find peace.

DD SS thread ","Do not let you kids suffer. Its absolut selfish.  
 Yes you pain is real, the world sucks and life is not fair. And yes you can be sad and depressed even with loving familiy, kids, money and friends. The void is there, and you feel ashamed, because others seem to suffer more.   
But it's not a competition  
It do not matter, you pain is real and burning now, but you have an obligation, you will punish you GF and kids if you just leave.   
I know that feeling... try with less sleep, for a few day, if possible. Just to shut up your mind.  
And set a goal for youself, in a far future maybe. A week of camping just for you, a travel to a country you ever dreamed of, see you kids off to collage.... Try somthing new, go out, work out..."

The interaction of our physical body with the environment, so thoughts are a product of our DNA and then our brains so our emotions ,those  will interact with the environment and produce these thoughts, so if you have thoughts that you don't think are correct, look at yourself from above and think what is the missing piece in your story? What is the thing that ruins the drawing and changing it could change things, of course my words may sound reductive but think what can you do? What are the things that you can change? You cannot replace your brain, but you can influence it through medications and psychotherapy, whether CPT, ECR, or any other treatment. You cannot replace your genes, but you can influence your body, such as exercising, eating healthy food, etc. You may be in an environment that does not suit you or does not harmonize with your surroundings. There is always a solution, but you have to look for it. Certainly, in light of such ideas, thinking and movement may be very difficult, but let's talk realistically, you have to try, as much as you can and do not feel very exhausted.

A weird way to overcome depression,"Last year I rolled my vehicle. It changed me forever. I definitely got lucky, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.



I was simply on my way to work. I live 15 miles away from my job in North Dakota. I only mention the state because we get plenty of weather. I went to pass a Semi truck and turned sideways even though I thought the road was dry. Next thing i know i was going towards a 5 foot ice wall fast. I remember hitting it and then nothing. I woke up in nothingness and I remember that.



I'm sorry if that seems like a lot of detail. It took me 6 months to realize I wasn't depressed anymore. It's been over a year now and I just don't have those terrible thoughts. I feel conflicted because 20 years of intrusive thoughts exist in my head, but now I'm different.","I also rolled my car recently. Certainly opened my eyes but also forced my life to slow down to walking speed, figuratively and literally. thank you for sharing glad you’re okay."

Extreme (and random) bouts of depression,"I keep having these random extended bouts of depression lately. When it comes on I just feel so deeply sad that it just hurts to breathe or speak, like I'm choking. That feeling like you're going to start sobbing at any moment. And then I disassociate.

I'm in such a good place and have people around me that love me, yet I'm constantly feeling this deep depressive loneliness and cosmic sadness. Like life is being wasted on me.

And then it goes.",I've had those intense waves of sadness you described. It was when I was wearing off my medication. It lasted for 2 to 3 months. It was basically a withdrawal symptom... something is changing your brain chemistry. Could be the season or perhaps you need a little boost.

"I thought I could be loved, I was wrong","I have reached a point in my life where I feel tired of everything. I have been suffering from depression since I was 13, now I am 20, and nothing has improved, it has even become harder to bear. Three months ago, I had a period where I thought I was going to die because I had a lot of panic attacks. These have subsided since I started taking Buspirone and Zoloft, but the feeling of sadness won’t go away. Plus, two days ago, I gathered the courage to tell the person I love how I feel about her. We have known each other since we were 7 years old, we went to middle school together, and now we are at the same university, but in different specializations. She is at the Faculty of Mechanics, and I am at the Faculty of Construction. To cut a long story short, she told me that we are just good friends and nothing more. I feel sad, I thought maybe I would find someone who understands me and, besides that, could also love me. Anyway, I feel sadder than usual. But the medication is working because if this had happened before I started taking it, maybe I would have taken my own life. The thing is, I don’t see any sense in all this nonsense. We come into this world without being asked. We have to endure the ugly and the beautiful of life without wanting it. Yes, it’s hard to exist. So many years I thought I could be loved, I was terribly wrong, and I lived a lie. I hate that I am the way I am because I know no one seeks sadness in life, and I, with my pessimistic ideas about existence, do nothing good about it. I won’t drag it out any longer, if you got this far. Thank you for listening.","I understand this so so much. Until the first time I told someone I loved them I was so unaware of myself and how I was perceived. Rejection is crippling and self destructive because it makes you think about what’s wrong with you or what you did and said. The truth is that, there’s nothing wrong with you. You didn’t say or do anything wrong. You did something brave and loving and you should be proud of that. It’s important to recognize that, just as you aren’t able to decide what feelings you have for her, she isn’t able to either. You can’t make yourself not love her and she can’t make herself love you, and it fucking sucks and it hurts, but something you can decide is to love yourself."

Some people just really have that good life huh,"Today is one of those many days of suicidal state, except this time, instead of inward of just feeling down... i feel outward, such as witnessing and realizing other people's life. Some people really do just have it easy huh. Married someone, move abroad, travelling spouse, have a home, and when they have a kid, that kid is just beautiful, smart and you know won't be giving you any problem. Like not difficult to look after. Some part deep in me, was able to feel that God has written their life to be wonderful, fun, easy and blessed.... tremendously.... what about me? some people just have it all huh.

I am here fighting of unemployment, worrying everything with my savings down to the last scrap, and having no support at all.

I write in another suicide thread that today was one of the day where i felt like i can finally do it. Guess today is just really bad. Anything that could go bad did went bad. Like a chain of misfortune just don't work out well. ","I can say from firsthand experience that the things you've listed are certainly nice, but does not necessarily mean that life is good for them.

I'm in my 40s.  I had a wonderful childhood up until age 14.  I own a home, got married to the most wonderful woman in the world almost three years ago, have several friends who I consider family, manage a nice French restaurant in the DC/Metro area, and am financially secure.

I've also suffered from depression since I lost my father in 96, and my older sister in 99.  I have all of these wonderful things in my life, and I will always be grateful, but it doesn't take the hurt of loss away.  I struggle every day to continue living, and it sucks a big ol' donkey dick.

Why do I continue to live?  I do it for my wife and those that I've lost.  I don't want my wife to have to go through the loss of her spouse.  I saw what it did to my mother, and it's not good.  I feel obligated to do right by my father and sister, who watched over me and taught me how to be a good person.  Without those who truly care/cared about me; I'd be dead or in prison, so I feel a need to carry on.  I also want to see what else life will throw at me.  Will I reach a breaking point?  Who really knows.  I'm still here right now, and that's good enough for me at the moment.

I wish you well in life.  Things are not great for you right now, and it will take time, but please stick with it.  I and those on this subreddit are here when you need a reminder"

feeling lost and stuck in a cycle,"I don’t know where to start, but I’m really struggling, and I don’t know how much longer I can keep going like this. I feel like I’m losing touch with everything that used to matter.

I’ve been staying up late — really late — like 7 AM in the morning late. Today, I finally managed to sleep at 9 AM, but my sleeping schedule is completely messed up. I haven’t eaten anything in hours, and when I do eat, I end up overeating, just to feel something. I know my health is deteriorating, but I don’t have the energy or willpower to fix it.

The worst part is, all I think about is money. I’ve got enough of it to survive, but I’m constantly stressing over it. I made about $400 this month, which is a decent amount here in Bangladesh, but I spent it all. Now I have nothing, and I’m waiting for my mom to send me money. If she doesn’t, I’m afraid I might starve. And yet, despite all of this, I feel like a failure, like I’m completely lost.

I don’t talk to my parents much anymore. I haven’t had a real conversation with them in weeks, and I haven’t even gone to class for the last three months. I’m living in a university dorm where everyone is just as lost as I am. They stay up till 5 AM, smoking and living a life I don’t want, but feel stuck in. I’m trapped in this cycle, and I’m not even sure I want to keep going.

I’ve been struggling with my faith too. I follow Islam, but lately, I’ve been doing things I know I shouldn’t. I’ve been sinning, cheating people out of what they deserve, acting rude and toxic — and I actually thought it was “cool” for a while. I’ve even started joking about my religion, and some days, I feel like I might be losing my faith entirely.

All I can think is that I’m living like an animal. I don’t have friends, no one cares about me, and if I were to die today, I don’t think anyone would even visit my grave. I just feel so alone in this world. I’m so depressed, and sometimes, I honestly think it would be better if I weren’t here at all.

I don’t want to keep living like this. I don’t know how to get out of this dark hole, but I can’t seem to stop sinking deeper.

I guess I’m just looking for someone who might understand what I’m going through, or at least someone who could help me see things differently. I feel like I’ve lost everything, but maybe there’s still a way back. I just need to know I’m not the only one feeling like this.

Thanks for reading.",I would love to talk to you if you want. We have similar story’s

 Everyday I get up for work and I just think ""Why? What's the point? I'm going to go to a job I hate, so that I can earn a few hundred dollars a week, in order to sustain a life that I don't want to live?"". 

Well, it was a good run anyway.

Is it panic attack or impending heart attack?,"I've been dealing with severe stress and depression for years due to a particular issue. I'm currently feeling chest tightness, pain in my chest, and discomfort in my stomach.

The past few days, I've been having suicidal thoughts and I've cried a lot.

Since yesterday, I've been breathing heavily AND my chest feels tight. I try to change position, but I still feel the same way.

I'm trying to relax and not overthink, but I still feel that huge pressure on my chest.

Fuck life ,Reality hit me like a motherfucker im a mess mentaly and physically i barely have friends no girlfriend no job and no goal in life.My intrusive thought's are winning and im crashing out hard i have nothing to live for.,"Man I'm 90% like you , your situation , I recently found a new perspective of life for my own sakes ! I think we don't have to be happy , who says that ? Why are we constantly thinking we are not happy !? Maybe it's okay , maybe we should take it easy on ourselves, maybe we have to do some selfless deeds, do something that helps to change our perspective of life , give us a new meaning , not that kind of meaning that society thinks ! I know we need jobs , because that's life ! We have to get by ! But it will finally happen, we will finally find love ! If not , no biggie ! Do something that makes a difference! Like putting more trees on the planet ! Or something ! My whole point is that we are rushing things maybe most of it is because of things that we get worried about so much ! Don't get me wrong I'm struggling like you , but this is what I'm thinking nowadays"

"I feel like I need help again, but I don’t know how to tell my husband. ","We’re both 23, we’ve been married for five years. I’ve dealt with depression pretty frequently, but in the household I was raised in, it was better to hide problems than to ask for help. 

Any illness, symptom, or anything like that, that would require professional help, was an incredibly huge inconvenience for my dad. Or even just staying home from school, there was no “resting” to get better. You had to do something while you were home. You were never really sick. *So,* I’ve grown into an adult that is petrified of being sick. Taking time to rest. Calling out of work. 

I don’t even currently work, I quit my job when we moved and decided to stay that way until after the holidays. I do everything around the house, and if I need a day to rest and get better from anything, I am riddled with guilt. 

Last year, I ended up in a situation where I had to see a psychiatrist in a hospital. Scared the daylights out of my husband. I continued to see her, but she wasn’t a great fit. I ended up quitting after so many rescheduled appointments on her end. 

I’m sure it’s just something to do with the time change or something like that. I deal with depression outside of the time change, but it does tend to get worse this time of the year. Normally, I’m able to hide it. As much as I want to rot in bed and just stare at the wall. Or cry. I know it’s a common thing for people with depression to say it isn’t just being sad. And it isn’t, but god, I am so fucking sad. I’m riddled with guilt over nothing. I feel like a dead weight. A burden. I’m tired of crying and hiding it. I still end up getting up in the morning, doing all my normal tasks throughout the day. I clean, I cook, I even take care of myself. 

But the gnawing feeling I have in my chest is so unbearable. 

I feel so guilty for feeling like I need to tell my husband this. My life is *so* easy, I’m incredibly lucky to be able to stay home like I do. We can afford it. He works long hours and when he gets home, I’m very sure the last thing he wants to talk about is his wife and her feelings and how awful she feels when he would probably kill to be in my position. Even though I know for a fact, he’d want me to tell him how I feel. He said those exact words to me when he picked me up from the hospital. 

I feel so… ungrateful? I’m in a position that many people in my life are jealous of, and I can’t even be happy about it? I can’t even enjoy it? I know I need to talk to him. No matter how closely he pays attention to me when we’re together, he’d never pick up on it. I’ve made sure of it, I’ve perfected my method in hiding it, so I have no choice but to communicate this problem to him and it terrifies me. I’m terrified of the questions he’ll ask about how I feel. I’m terrified of what answers I’ll give. Or how he’ll react. 

I spent my entire life having my father get angry with me for not being fine, I always expect the same from him, even though it’s never happened. He’s never once gotten upset over anything being wrong with me. He wasn’t even necessarily upset when he picked me up from the hospital and didn’t know anything that had happened, he was worried. He was scared. He just wanted to know I was okay. No arguments, no lectures, no fighting. I just don’t know how to even start the conversation. ","Hey friend.  Your life is *not* easy. sounds like you have stability at home and are thankful for that, but your life is not easy. You’re suffering from a very shitty illness and you deserve to get treatment. 

Your guilt and thoughts about yourself and situation - those are *symptoms*. not reality. distorted perceptions. That’s the depression talking, don’t trust it.  

Roles reversed, if your husband was feeling like this, and hid it from you, how would you feel about that?  

Given your upbringing, makes sense that your instinct is to hide how bad your symptoms are. But you don’t have to do that anymore. Don’t hide. Tell your husband what is happening, and get the treatment you need and deserve. 

it’s OK that you are afraid to talk to him about this. You can just tell him that. you might try saying something like – “I’ve been feeling off lately and my instinct is to hide it and pretend nothing’s wrong. I’m worried how you’ll react. Makes me feel like I’m a burden or complaining. So I haven’t told you. but I’m going to try to.” 

Your husband knows something’s wrong. He doesn’t know what. trust him and tell him what’s going on with you.     Sending well wishes."
I don’t know,"  Hello guys, I’m new here but I just want anonymous people to listen to me. I’m a 18 year old male, my gf of two years left me, I’m stressed about school, work, and my ex. I’m happy and okay during the day, but the hardest part is the night. I have past history of depression and suicidal tendencies. I thought I over came them but I’m back at it again. I just want to be happy again. I miss my baba (ex)",Hi friend. Losing a gf is difficult I’m going through it too. It’s coming up to 6 months now. Does it hurt still? Yes. But it’s about doing things you enjoy and replacing the memories with new ones. Stress about school and work is a problem that we can all go through. Just know that you’re making progress. Certainly it can be worse at night. As we end our day and distracting ourselves we are forced to think about our life just before bed. This call lead us to not sleep well and put us on a bad path for the next day. I love you and you can do this.
I’m really fucking tired and don’t know what to do ,I’m in physical and mental pain every day it’s just a dull constant aching that never leaves i don’t want to wake up anymore cause I know I’ll just sit around not really enjoying anything like usual I’m trying to not drink or smoke or go back to my addictions but it’s getting unbearable again I’ve asked for therapy but that was a few days ago and I haven’t heard anything i just want the pain to end ,"Hi mr bean, 

I came to this subreddit feeling a lot of the same things so you’re not alone in this. I’m really proud of you for taking care of yourself by not giving into unhealthy coping mechanisms, seriously pat yourself on the back that’s huge! Do you have any healthy hobbies or activities that bring you joy? Any artists or bands who bring peace and serenity when you listen to them? 

Life can be sooooo overwhelming sometimes and giving up can sounds like the best alternative, I understand that deeply but idk I’m a firm believer that we should try to push thru for whatever reason. I really hope you can get some mental health support. Until then I’d be glad to support you to the best of my abilities under this post!! Best wishes to you 🥰"

Is my brain fried from stress or have other people thought like this too,I am an 18 year old female and I have thought what if I was kidnapped and raped I don’t know if it’s my mind or me but I’ve never done IT before and never had a significant other so I don’t know why. This one pops in my brain the most but others do to like what if I crashed my car and didn’t have my memory or team over my a car they are all leading to trauma so idk what do you think?,It's kind of normal to have these thoughts. They can be sad to think about but you just have to focus on something else. If you start to fascinate yourself and can only think about it over and over it becomes a problem.

There is also a fairly significant amount of research coming out about the effects of medium to long term, consistent cannabis use, and its not as promising as we were hoping as a long term solution.

There are more promising studies on novel interventions that I would suggest finding a qualified, medical professional to discuss."

I knew it was legal in UK but tbh i haven’t tried to get a prescription

I just booked with this black friday sale

Curious if anyone else has tried it :)",Exactly. I just need a moment of peace.
I dont feel like im real anymore?,"Burner acc for whatever reason as i dont really have one but i think this ties into what im thinking as of late, i kind of dont have a reason anymore? Like i just stopeed and thats it. I feel as if the content that i've always held dear to me due to lets say their emotional and philosophical depth have completely made me stop caring for my self, while not really making me give up they have stopped me(?) from continuing. To give some contenxt im fairly young and by fairly i mean less than 20 yet ever since ive been little the interest for games or series which can or have a reputation of deeply affecting the reader have always attracted me and this has only gotten worse as i grow, i feel in a way like i want to stop existing as theres no point, compared to the storys and games ive read and played whats mine got to do with anything, i know it sounds stupid even more so because most of these works either end in a positive way or have extremely positive teachings about oneself and life(Examples are Nier, houseki no kuni, vagabond, the climber, cyberpunk(both game and anime) amomg others) yet for some reason even if my heart is willing to understand these feelings that i get from such stories it doesnt embrace them, it makes me kind of not care for me as i like, stop existing because i'll never be ""there"" if that makes any sense and thus i kinda just cant be in touch with reality anymore, its as if my brain and heart have both been trapped in an untangible cage of appreciation and deep interest for these types of story while completely deleting themselves from the picture, not even acknowledging that they just as the ones in the story are human too? Im srry if this is all over the place but its a thought ive had in my mind for a while now ","Hi dear, nothing you’re saying sounds stupid. It’s all very valid. Topics and pretty much everything in this world and existence can be very complicated and heavy.. it’s sounds like you’re dealing with a lot of overwhelming and complex feelings. Have you tried talking to a professional to try and sort this stuff out? When we sit alone with really big emotions and thoughts it tends to feel never ending and the idea of relief from those feelings becomes incomprehensible. You’re definitely not alone and I hope you can get some relief ❤️"
being the kind of tired sleep can't fix sucks,"Every time I wake up I look up at the ceiling wishing I didn't, I go through my day and my head never stops hurting, there is this constant noise, it doesn't have a sound, but it's there, and it won't leave. and there is nothing I can do to ease it, everything tiers me out and I don't find enjoyment in anything, I end up going to my bed to sleep, maybe engage in self-destruction or force myself to do something or watch something knowing I won't enjoy it. day by day I lose the will to live, accompanied by all my self-hatred, troubles, worries and issues, death doesn't sound so bad anymore. so why can't I just do it? every day I think about it, every day I get worse, I think to myself that I might not even want to get better. so why after all of this can't I just do it? but yk what, shit happens, you live and you die, and that's the gist of it.

Objectively Don't See Any Reason to Live Anymore,"So I've reached a point in my life where I truly and objectively don't see a reason to keep living anymore. 

I'm 33 now (male) and just truly do not see any legitimate reason to continue living. My dream in life was to become a successful singer-songwriter releasing and performing my own original music but after trying countless different paths towards this dream since I was 19, I've never even been within a million miles of even just having a shot at it. I truly do not see this dream happening anymore at this point no matter what I do or try or how hard I work towards it. I know that this dream is a one in a hundred million chance even if you're super talented but it was what I wanted out of my life but I just don't see any possibility for it anymore. 

I am completely alone in regards to romantic relationships. I can't even count the number of times I've had my heart broken over crushes or potential relationships that didn't end up panning out. I've only had 1 long-term relationship that lasted about 9 months but other than that I've never been able to be with anyone I wanted to be with. It's at a point now where I completely see that I will never be able to be with someone I'm attracted to and want to be with and that I will be alone forever. I don't have any friends because anytime I did, they always ended up hurting me and/or their morals and ways of going about life were incompatible with minebso I didn't want to keep the friendship going. 

I have a job working remotely as a pricing administrator for a manufacturing company and I absolutely hate it. The work involves extreme scrutiny and attention-to-detail towards data and prices all day and extensive use of Excel and it's in complete opposition to my personality. The only thing good about this job is I can work from home as if I had to work in the office I couldn't handle it because I feel everything so deeply and being in a noisy office surrounded by people all day completely exhausts me as I feel everything (emotions) from everyone all the time so it's beyond draining and stressful. 

I am extremely highly sensitive and feel emotions unbelievably deeply, not only my own but others' as well. I have always been this way and just going about in life day to day is beyond exhausting. Because of my nature like this, I found at 16 that writing songs allowed me a catharsis of releasing my extreme feelings that nothing else ever allowed me or ever has since then. This is why I wanted to become a singer-songwriter so badly as it allowed me a path through life that let me make sense of life and myself unlike anything else ever had. But that dream is truly dead and buried now. 

So what reason is there to keep living when I don't have anything left to live for and truly don't see anything worth going on for in life? I have come to see life as absolutely pointless now as we all will die one day anyhow so what point is there to life if you know in your heart you'll never have any of the things you truly wanted? Why go on when you know there's nothing left but suffering for you? I believe that God or whatever higher power is out there truly has something against me as nothing I do or try to improve my life ever comes to be. I haven't done anything horrible enough to justify this type of constant suffering and emotional turmoil in life and I just dont understand it.  ","But you are a singer songwriter. Whether or not that brings you monetary value I guess is the question. But it must bring you at least some joy to do it, and just to be able to watch it or share it with people either through YouTube or small performances is a gift. So many people go through life without such a passion it really is a great gift you have."
Feel like I’m doing nothing/going nowhere in life,"I know I’m 16 yr old, but I feel like my life has no meaning or future. Doing terrible in school, in 11th been getting F’s almost every class since 7th. Did no sports really no friends no girlfriends I sit in my room play games eat sleep repeat. Only thing I sometimes go hang out with my cousins or every weekday I take my 1yr old sister to daycare and pick her up but thinking about my future scares me. I feel like I might end up working a low paying job barely scraping by. I feel ashamed and disappointed in my self as my dad wants me to do better but he thinks my mistakes in life of not paying attention in school and only caring about games is his fault saying he has failed me.

I don’t know where to go in life and it truly makes me think I might just kill myself when I’m older because maybe that will be the only option I have to go. It’s dumb to think this way I know but it’s truly terrifying with the way my life could be going. ","Yeh same, I’m 17 and only just failed school Fucking sucked because I wanted to be the first in my family to graduate. Rest of my family is very successful though without them graduating.

I just feel like my future is just so messed, I have no idea what I would like to do with my future and everyone around me somehow seems to have already figured it out and I don’t and that scares me. Thought about killing myself to and still do."

Has a degree or academic focus ruined anyone’s life?,For me focusing on school and studying a lot destroyed me in many ways. I want to know if anyone can relate to this and what I can do or support groups I can join.,"What’s your degree/major? Bio degree was brining me out. I went from racing motocross, kayaking, gym and so much more to simply grinding on my computer for days on end and endless homework. 

Yeah it pretty much destroyed my life and motivation. Gained a stupid amount of weight as well because I normally eat like trash, but I used to be so active that it didn’t matter."

It’s like social media addiction but without the social. And replace media with 4 hours of math everyday. It has all the physical harm and mental isolation

Genuinely join a club or find a close by hobby to separate yourself from the school work every now and then. It’s so bad to grind school everyday and have it weigh you down so heavy.
Being too aware makes me depressed.,"I’m never going to not be depressed unless I get a lobotomy or someshit. I was born, given cards and obliged to play with them until it’s game over.

I really strive for nothing and the only feeling it creates is either sadness or indifference. Like I’m sitting in a boring waiting room until I die.

In my eyes, they’re the real winners, because that blindness is their drive that makes them happier.","I often feel the same, recently I talked to my mother who is the complete opposite of me. She is just living life, never questioning anything, she never had big goals or anything either. I am a bit jealous but also shocked, how people can walk around and not question their existence...

I realized that I wish I would believe in God. To have some kind of trust in everything. Some grounding. But as a raised atheist that is a choice I would have to make consciously."

It is absurd to look upon the enormous amount of pain that abounds everywhere in the world, and originates in needs and necessities inseparable from life itself, as serving no purpose at all and the result of mere chance. Each separate misfortune, as it comes, seems, no doubt, to be something exceptional; but misfortune in general is the rule."" :)"

These days I don’t have much going for me. Wake up at 5am-get home from work at 4pm. Eat, shower pass out and do it all over again. Don’t enjoy what I do for work, but I’d never find anything with a similar salary without have a degree. I live in Canada and clear 1280$ every week but still struggle everyday financially. Ever since I bought my house it’s been tough. I had read something in one of these groups that someone had an idea about taking one last trip. Meaning using your credit cards/LOC and take “one last” trip around the world or to your most favourite place and then call it a night , if you know what I mean. Ever since I read that it really got me thinking. I have about 55k in available credit, it would be one hell of a trip before I’m home bound. Maybe I’m just crazy. I’ve made an itinerary of where I’d go and what I’d do. 
If you’re reading this, I’m sorry you’re here. In this group, reading these negative posts. I hope all of you win your battles you tell nobody about. ",Sounds hard.
Tired of trying,"I just wanted to vent... I think I've been depressed all my life, I'm in my 30s now. I'm just so tired of trying... I tried different therapy modalities, different meds, yoga, all kinds of stuff to get better... And I still feel this emptiness, loneliness, pain, suffering, and hopelessness. I truly hate feeling like this, it's so exhausting... I hope we all get better eventually and find some satisfying way of living in this world... Thanks for reading all this. ",I feel the same.

","I also suffer and try to find one thing per day to ease the pain - whether it’s a walk with my dog, a hug from a tree, a coffee with a friend or a gummy & a wine on my own. I’m 52 and have never felt “home” here on earth, many failed attempts that have landed me in hospitals and psych wards so now instead of the ideation I try to find small glimmers of joy in simple things. Be safe and go easy on yourself ♥️"

Lonely and very tired of life. I’ve never had much luck from antidepressants either which sucks. I think the loneliness aspect really grinds you down, like an axe. I get tired of trying and putting myself out there because it never works out. I don’t have any hope for the future and it gets hard to keep going when there’s nothing to look forward to."

I really don't know what to do,"Hello so my sister is 22 yo she has serious depression she's been depressed for as long as I can remember 
She's genuinely a very hopeless and sad person (aka depressed) her only hope and aspiration in life is to die she's just living till that happens she has no plans for her life because she's just waiting for the moment where she just drops dead and no longer has to deal with her life
She had one suicide attempt that she told me about when she was 15yo but it was minor (I'm sorry if that's inappropriate) since then I don't think she's had any incidents 
She goes on these hunger strikes almost where she would spend 4 to 3 days where doesn't eat anything of any substance I know she's eating something she's not fully starving but never a meal it's almost a self harm kind of thing she's trying to stay as hungry as possible 
I'm sorry this is hard to write and I'm not a writer obviously so I have no sense of story telling or structure and it's very hard to summerize a person in a few words 
The point of this post is to ask yall for any kind of advice I've tried talking to her numerous times but she's THE MOST HARDHEADED PERSON TO EXIST it is impossible to convince her to do anything she doesn't want to do I've asked her to get help to do something anything and I know how hard it is in practice I've struggled with depression myself I've attempted suicide 4 times but I got help I'm on medication now and I'm much better now one of the reasons it took me so long to get help was because I wanted to keep her company in her sadness I wanted to be miserable with her so I can always relate to her so I really really genuinely care for her I have nothing but love for her she's my favorite sister she's so funny and intriguing and amazing and wonderful but I just don't know how to help her I feel so helpless 
I know how serious depression is so I know if I don't do something I'm gonna lose her and I can't I really can't it's my worst nightmare 
I'm even considering giving her my antidepressants without her knowing putting it in something and giving it to her I'm just so lost and I'm so very desperate for anything that could help her",how and when did her sense of hopelessness and depression begin?

Advice/vent,"I’ve had major depressive episodes in the past but this is the worst it’s ever been. I feel like because of my depression, my ability to think has been taken away from me. I’m an engineering student and I’ve gotten good grades in the past but I just can’t. My depression has me convinced that I have no curiosity and no desire to challenge myself. I come from a comfortable upbringing (just turned 20) and am suicidal because I feel like I’m literally too lazy to handle the adult world and will end up unaccomplished. I feel disconnected from my friends and family and  like I have nothing to say/contribute to conversations. I want to work harder but don’t know how. I’m terrified of the consequences of my own lack of logic and ability to make good decisions. I feel like a shell of a human being, I’m at the point where I just eat, use the bathroom, sleep, and sit around biting my nails.

Does anyone relate to this? Right now it feels like there’s no way out

Right now I’m home for the holidays and finishing my school at home and I’m just disgusted by myself and I can’t stop. So much mental energy goes there instead of towards improving myself or even just living life.","I felt like this to for years, it’s really hard to snap out of but once you get out everything is great again.

I do feel like sometimes I took the easy way out, I took adhd meds to get me out of that mental situation. So Kudo’s to you if you get out of that situation you will be more of an adult then I ever will be."

Am I unlovable? ,"Just wanting to vent, someone to talk to would be nice though. 

I (22M) have this ex that I’ve never been able to move on from. We started dating when I was 17, and she’s the sweetest girl I’ve ever met to this day. To clarify we lived together but we broke when I turned 19, so it’s been 3 years no contact. But we had the most loving relationship, we went through struggle together. So much of it, it always felt like we were in a hole but I had her by my side so I felt invincible. We were just so young, and didn’t have the means to do a lot of things financially. Got evicted two times, and she was still there with me trying to find solutions all while loving me and I her. Until I succumb to alcohol because I couldn’t handle the stress, I would drink so much to the point where I wouldn’t talk to her and would be gone. I was a shitty person and I understand that, so for obvious reasons she left me. Over these past 3 years I’ve grown so much, I stopped drinking like I did and actually learned to cope in other ways like going to the gym or just by going on walks when I’m stressed out I even lost 30lbs. After some time I found myself thinking of her more and more, so I tried even harder to become a better person. Not just for me but for her if the day were to ever come yk. And well that day came about a month ago, and she was just as sweet as the day we met. I was honestly surprised because yk I used to be an alcoholic. So we caught up, and we talked about everything. She made it known to me that she wanted to start from a new, and ofc I was ecstatic about it. We even met up a little over two weeks into it and we just held on to each other like there was no tomorrow. And so she was telling me all of these sweet things, I did the same. I love her with every fiber of my being, and today she tells me otherwise. She said she’s in love with me still but it wasn’t the right time. Which id understand, so I’m a mess right now. I wanted to have a drink, honestly. But that’d do more bad than good. And I don’t want to fall into old habits again, especially after working on myself so much. But I guess this begs the question am I unloveable? Do I not deserve it? at least that’s how I’m feeling right now. ","Wow this was a splendid read. It sounds like a really special connection. I’m really happy to hear you’ve cleaned yourself up!!! Even happier to hear you didn’t give back into drink with what’s happened, I’m very proud of you, keep up the hard work. 

I don’t believe you’re being fair to yourself or her by assuming this means you are unlovable or that you do not deserve this but I can understand why you would feel that way. It might be a good idea to ask her to discuss further how she is feeling and why she had decided this isn’t the right time. Perhaps there’s things that have gone unsaid that should be addressed. Wishing you the best!!"

She’s a religious person, and she told me that god spoke to her and said right now wasn’t the right time. I’m somewhat religious myself, and still trying to build a relationship with god. So I understand, I’ve been praying to become a better man not just for me but for her if she ever came back. Maybe this is gods way of telling me that I’m not quite there yet?

Welp.,"Hopefully this is it. I'm gonna shower, make a couple of voice memos to leave behind, get ready to look somewhat presentable, and go for it. 

I haven't fully prepared like cleaned my apartment, canceled subscriptions, wrote a will. I was able to see everyone I wanted to see this week though. It always felt like the right moment before whenever I attempted, but failed each time.

It doesn't feel like the right moment this time, but I don't wanna hold it off anymore. That's as good of a time as any.

See ya.",Hi wait please can talk for a bit please??

"Depression/suicidal thoughts opinions go both ways (Awarness purposes, no conflict intended, feel free to share opinion)","I explained this in the best way I can so please bear with me :]

People talk about ""Oh yeah, everyone is depressed/suicidal nowadays."" Which is true, but think about the kind of world we live in. The way it affects us. Now, that being said, I do believe it's also the fact that people need to stop treating depression/suicide like it's some kind of trend people are following. Depression/suicide are serious things and take hundreds of lives every year. For those out there (don't lie, I know you exist and I have friends guilty of it) who are putting on a depression/sucidal facade, please don't. Please be mindful of these types of things. It's always all shits and giggles until you lose someone from depression.","People can also suffer from a kind of impostor syndrome, which can make them reluctant to talk about it out of fear they may be perceived as ""faking it,"" even subconsciously. This reluctance to come forward can be enhanced if depression is viewed as ""trendy"" or there is a perception of it being used as a tool for attention."
Why am I unlovable ,I(24M) have been engaged 2 times in the last 3 years and both of them left me I gave so much to them I got there lives put back together I helped them through so much trauma loved them unconditionally more than anything I was faithful and loyal and protective I still have scars from fights to protect them and in the end it's all I'm left with a broken body and a broken heart nobody will ever love me I don't know what to do anymore ,"As someone who’s been used before and never been properly loved before, I can say that you my friend are incredibly unlucky, it’s not that your unlovable, it’s that the people that you’re in a relationship with arent great people. Don’t think that you did anything wrong cuz you didn’t. I’ve low-key been in like 30 talking stages before that have all consistently failed due to different reasons, one of the most prevalent being that they would just not put in any effort whatsoever. I blamed myself for it and thought I was unlovable because of my personality but have faith, because, 4 in every 100 women are gems (loyal people who will unconditionally love you and never leave you). My friend, it’s not that you’re doing anything wrong, it’s just you need a bit of luck to find a gem. We both do tbh. 

Have some respect for yourself, you are a legend and trust me, soon you’ll find a gem, I’m sure of it :)"

i hate hot i can't be honest,"i hate how i have to pretend that I'm not as suicidal as i am even though I already have a date planned. 
i hate how if i were to tell a therapist that, they would send me to the mental ward.
i hate how my mother keeps making me feel worse, and when i tell her that, she said it's all my fault and that i don't appreciate anything she does, even though all she does is yell at me.
i hate how everybody pressures me to study for my finals, even though I know I'm not going to take part in them because i will be dead.
i hate how when i tell them that it really can't get better for me they gaslight me into thinking that's it's just the way I feel. yeah there's a reason for it. it's because that's the way it fucking is.","I think I understand you. What you’re describing is exactly how I felt when I was 16. Then the pandemic started, and I fell into drugs—mostly because my parents had no idea how I felt, and they didn’t even want to know. For another year, I lived in one huge lie. When everything came out, my mom finally realized what was happening and started trying to help me.

It led to a stay in a mental ward. I was hospitalized at a children’s ward since I was two months shy of turning 18. That’s enough about me for now, but here’s what I want to tell you: I hated every fucking one, and most hated fucker was myself, back then. And most of all, I hated the doctor who sent me there.

When I got back home, I was still the same angry idiot. It took me another year to quit drugs, but I managed it because of one thing. When I returned home, my parents were totally different. Sure, they kept an eye on me, but they stopped treating me like I was 12 years old.

Everything changed—not just them, but everyone around me. They finally understood how close I was to taking my own life, and they realized I wasn’t the person they thought I was, or maybe the person they wanted me to be.

What I’m trying to say is this: I know you’re going through hell, and you probably don’t want to open up to anyone. But until you tell your therapist and psychiatrist the full truth, they won’t be able to help you.

Maybe you don’t really want to help yourself right now, but I believe there’s something deep inside you that still wants to live. Life isn’t a nice place to be, but there’s no better option.

I don’t know you, and if you died tomorrow, I probably wouldn’t feel much. But you remind me of my own past. I still deal with a lot of shit in my head, and this past year has been extremely stressful and hard. I’ve thought about using drugs again or ending it all almost every day.

But even though winter is here, I feel like I’m entering a better phase of my life.Hold on, stay stromg. Don’t let any motherfucker take your live, you can not give up to them. Ily, and I hope you’ll find same long and fucking road to feel lucky, like I did."
Career ,"I'm 31m and although I have steady employment it doesn't pay enough for me to do anything but survive, let alone live on my own. I'm supposed to climb the latter now and get certification to go up and earn more money. Problem is I have zero motivation to do this. The stress and responsibilites are not worth it for me. I know myself well enough by now to say with 95% certainty that I will burn out and or lose my job. The worse part is there is nothing I feel that could make it worth it. Life is that crappy imo.

Just needed to vent I guess. Cause my options are shit.","I don’t know how much my word matters to you, probably not a lot, but I believe you can do it. Chat with me if you need a voice or someone to vent on."
22M and i have a problem,"Backstory:  
I would like to tell you a little bit about myself so you can get to know me better. I’m an ordinary young person living in Turkey. I'm an Agnostic. I had a difficult childhood. I was raised by indifferent parents. I’ve been through various things that I don’t want to talk about. Since my childhood, I’ve been trying to earn my mother’s and father’s respect and get praise from them, but even though I’m 22 years old, I haven’t been able to achieve this. Now, I don’t care about it anymore. (At least, I think I don’t care.) When I was sick, my family made me feel like I was a burden to them, and they talked about how I caused them financial trouble. I’m 160 cm tall and weigh 53 kg, I faced a lot of difficulties in school and wasn’t taken seriously because of my short stature. Until high school, I was even shy about socializing with people. In high school, I would switch from one character to another in order to be accepted by people, and even if I was treated badly, I would try very hard not to lose those people because the number of people I talked to was limited. After finishing high school, I didn’t go to university, and instead, I started focusing on developing myself. My parents behavior towards me created a sense of ambition and drive within me.

Today:  
Nowadays, I don’t talk to my family, but I have enough money to live on my own and buy anything I want. I participate in various social events, I smile every second, I treat people well, and I’m a more social person. However, the problem is that despite all this smiling and confidence, there are nights when I cry, and all I want is for someone to stroke my head or hug me. I want to meet up with a friend and talk to them every minute, and sometimes this can overwhelm the person I’m with. But unless I’m having face-to-face communication with someone, it doesn’t feel like a real connection. I always want more love, and no matter how much love I receive, it still feels insufficient. Also, no matter what I do, I can’t enjoy anything. My brain has started working in a materialistic way. Every time, I feel the urge to achieve some concrete success. Sometimes I feel like I can accomplish anything, but at other times, I feel like I won’t be able to achieve anything. Sometimes I make plans to meet up with my friends, but immediately afterward, I regret it and don’t want to go anymore. Also, I want to trust every smiling person. Even if there’s a chance they might hurt me, I want to believe they are a good person and give them a chance. I also daydream a lot, and sometimes I get so caught up in these fantasies that when I imagine myself shouting, there are times when I unconsciously move my mouth. What is my problem?

NOTE: I do not use any medication or drugs. I am far away from such things.","Dear j3ych,
Thank you for your honesty it's a brave thing to do. Maybe you feel your actions feels right even if they cause pain and problem. So if they feels right and also needs to change yes you will think there is a problem and you look for what it is. Maybe it's just a feeling of inferiority. 
I was like you I was looking for someone but after I realised the thing I was looking wasn't someone. It was me..  different me. So I understand I can't find this person outside of me. It was just a image of me created by my subconscious maybe my soul."
17m - My parents have given up on me,"I spent my whole life trying to make my parents proud. I got myself really into music, and I thought my parents would think it’s really cool. They didn’t, they were more focused on my younger sisters who are all prodigies in different sports or other things. It’s so clear that they’ve given up on me and It hurts. I hate waking up and knowing my own parents have given up on me. I had a pretty tough patch during Covid where my grades were bad which really affected my relationship with my dad. He called me a disappointment while he was already on an angry yelling episode, and something about that stuck me. My mom told me she’s given up on me. She caught me using Nicotine pouches, and told me I don’t even feel like her son anymore. I don’t know what to do anymore. I just want my parents to know i’m trying, and that I love them and I want them to love me back. I forgive them for what they’ve said and done to me. I feel so bad for everything I had to put them through, I’m their son so it makes sense they worry. I just don’t want them to give up on me. I know I’ll be something in life one day and I want to hear them say I’m proud of you when I finally accomplish my goals in life.","Hi Kurt, I’m sorry to hear what you’re going through. I think it’s really admirable that you posted this and that you’re taking the time to think about how you’re feeling about this situation. 

You mentioned you’re 17, I know for me this was a very stressful age. I know it won’t mean much to you now but I mean it wholeheartedly when I say things will get better. I think sometimes parents forget how difficult a time this chapter of your life is. Try to be kind to yourself kid ❤️"
the younger version of me would be so disappointed ,"i saw a similar post from a year ago. i googled it after having the same thought and decided to share my own thoughts. just to let it out

she’d wonder why is it so hard to get out of bed. why did i choose staying here in this city instead of moving to alaska or san francisco. why did i choose to stay with my boyfriend who’s cheated on me, who left me for a few months for his ex. i remember as a kid i hated when the girls in my family couldn’t do things because of their boyfriends and i told myself i’d never marry but here i am talking about marriage from this person and doing all the things i wouldn’t do in their situations and to never let a relationship hold me back (it’s a long story i’ll stop it there) why is it so hard to study why am i still here in this city with the person who i love but then remember what he did then i resent him and then i get embarrassed for being in this relationship and when i remember how much i cried to my family who aren’t the comforting type 

actually, there was so much more i wanted to type, but ill just end it here. - too angry with myself 

she’d hate me and i just want to quit everything and hide under the blankets for a few weeks","Reading your post, it feels like you already know what to do but maybe feel too scared to be alone with an uncertain future.

It doesn't sound like you have a partner who treats you very respectfully and I would urge you to think long and hard about commitment to marriage, especially if you have dreams of taking your life in the direction you dreamed of.

Can I ask what you would theoretically do if you were to split, do you have somewhere to go to such as back with your family or a friend etc?"
Is this how it will end?,"I don't wanna die. I want to enjoy my life as much as others do but it seems like I feel I'm a toxic person. I'm guilty of hurting my girlfriend emotionally and mentally, I'm a bad son, I'm not a good friend at all. I'm a failure and toxic person. But there's a part of me that tells me I should rest. I should rest forever. I don't want to take my life but I'm tired of thinking how I failed to give my best. I want to end it all. I want to quiet my mind but it's hard.

Depression has made me a bad daughter, friend, student. But… what I tell myself to stay alive is that the earth is 4.6 billion years old and our life is so short compared to that. Maybe human life is nothing too serious. Maybe nothing matters in the end."

These activities made me so upset when I was younger, and still even so as an adult. I taught in one of the wealthiest counties in my state and maybe 70% of the class would have a magical Disney trip or a skiing vacation in Colorado. I felt myself melting along with watching the dejected faces of the remaining 30% of the class. I finally decided I didn’t care what all the other teachers did; I refuse. Instead, we either completely ignore it or sometimes I’ll ask the kids “what’s the most boring thing you did over break?” I’ll tell them I deep cleaned or did taxes.

They are just giant reminders of what I’ll never have and what I’ll never be apart of. I wish I could just fast forward through Thanksgiving and Christmas. ",I took a glance and just want to say that nobody deserves to be in a relationship where they’re fearful or worry about the other partner being unable to control their emotions. I hope you look into maybe seeing a counselor or something because that sounds like an awful situation. Hope things get better for you.
What's wrong with me?,"I'm 14M I'm not diagnosed with anything but I think I might be depressed to be honest. This isn't one of those things where they say ""Omg! I cried once I must be depressed!"" type posts.

It's everyday, days either feel like seconds or years, I'm barely sleeping or eating, It's like there's this thickness in the air, I've felt like this for awhile now I would like to say a year or so.

I don't really know what to do, my parents know but I'm not medicated or seeing anyone about it, I don't think they know how bad it is.

I feel like it's the end of the world, and everyone should be freaking out and panicking but no one is, because to them it's a normal day but too me I'm struggling to know if it's gonna be my last.

I wish I could be cured of whatever this is depression or otherwise, I can barely live as it is and I don't think I could handle it if it worse.

Sorry for this little rant, if you read all this then props to you for making it to the end.",im also 14 in an similar position as you right now.yeah its like every day just pure unhappyiness and the world just is agiasint you.but please if things get to intense know that im you aint alone.

Everyone is experiencing different things for me in school it felt like my heart was going to explode if I didn't do the first thing that came into my head, I got in a lot of trouble. It's incredibly isolating to feel like no one can relate to that internal part of yourself. 

Try joining some club that interests you, sport, drama or amything. Talk to your friends or relatives about what you experience and ask if they have something similar.

As for the sleep, it might be a phone thing. This and the eating habits makes me think you might want to pursue some councilling."
I hate this ,"I hate being alone and feeling like I’m just in the way. 

No one wants to be around me. I feel unloveable. 


Depression sucks and I feel like I’m just digging out of a never ending hole. 

Why is happy so hard. ","Yo, listen up man. I know life can get tough sometimes and you're feeling down. But don't let that defeat you. Sure, you might be alone right now and feeling low, but that doesn't mean it'll always be this way. 

You gotta believe in yourself, bro. You're not just in the way, you're meant to be here doing your thing. You just gotta keep going and things will start looking up. 

And as for happiness, it's not some impossible thing. You just gotta find what makes you happy and go for it. You can playing some game, or reading a book. Happiness comes from everywhere.

Also:
If someone left you, forget them. They ain't worth your time. And when you come back with your success, they'll realize they made a mistake. They'll come crawling back, pretending to be excited for you, but don't give them the time of day. 

Focus on yourself and your own success, not on those who deserted you. You're better off without them in your life. Keep pushing forward and don't let anyone hold you back"

I don’t like being happy,"I started sertraline in August and I guess it’s made me slightly better but I don’t like it. Before I used to be really depressed, my mood was always super down. But now I feel strange. I feel stuck in between happy and sad, never fully leaning into either. I want to crawl back into the comfort of being sad. I like the familiarity of being depressed. ",Yeah steriline is like that try to stick through it eventually the mania dies down it also might just be your natural emotions coming up after being depressed for so long off it's really bad switch to a smaller dose

I want out now,Another day I woke up in this stupid world wish I could just die in my sleep or get shot walking down the street by someone random. I hate being alive after my mother died earlier this year from getting sepsis in a hospital and on top of that finding a job with no GED is challenging I can't even pay off my debt I hope I won't be here soon to escape this stupid life everyday I'm thinking of a way to kill myself ,"Stay, please."
feel like i have bpd,"im 15, i know its most likely hormones and what not, but i already have depression. the thing is, when i feel depressed, its not like guilt or shame, its loneliness, emptiness, boredom, and i get so desperate to talk to somebody, and its mainly caused by people i love romantically. my mood switches a lot, which i feel like thats normal because everyones moods do. i used to take lexapro, but it never really helped much. i dont even remember anything before yesterday, i take xanax a lot, and i drink everyday and smoke weed. i used to self harm but i stopped a few months ago, sometimes i still do but its rare. my mom wont take me to a doctor or anything. i made plans to ""kill myself"" so that she would HAVE to take me and get me evaluated. i never did it though because of the embarrassment. i just wanna know if this sounds like it could be bpd or if its really just depression and im going crazy.

edit: i know i most likely dont, but there is a lot more severity to it too, wouldnt say trauma but definitely things my mom has done doesnt help, and its not like i want it, i just want something that actually explains me. ","Difficult to say just based on your post, I'd recommend trying a few online tests/assessments. 

They're free and can be a good indicator of whether it's worth getting tested for BPD by a professional."

Is this considered trauma and could it be linked to my mental state/laziness?,"I never told this to anyone accept my sister who went through it too, but we don't get to details...

Growing up, my dad used to get drunk and fight with my mom. He was loud, threw things, and sometimes got physical. I suspect there were times when he sexually assaulted her because, after some fights, we'd find her clothes torn the next day.

He never hit me or my siblings, which is why I'm unsure if what I went through even counts as my trauma. Over time, my mom started fighting back, and eventually, things calmed down. Now, they act like a happy couple, and we have two younger sisters. But those earlier years still haunt me.
I often felt paralyzed during their fights, terrified for my mom and afraid of making things worse. I'd even try to ""help"" her by telling her what not to do to avoid setting him off, which I now realize wasn't fair. She probably wasn't in a good place mentally either.

At school, I struggled a lot-fighting with teachers, refusing to learn, and even being sent to a psychologist, though I never told them anything.

Now, I'm 19, and think I have dysthymia, and have been on antidepressants for six months. I struggle with motivation and feel ""lazy,"" which frustrates me, also have a social anxiety in certain situations. Could my childhood experiences be the reason? Does this count as trauma, even though I wasn't directly harmed?

I'd appreciate hearing any advice or similar experiences.
","Absolutely it counts. You don't have to be physically hurt to experience trauma. It's an experience that had a profound effect on your pysche. Being aware of a situation and not being able to do anything to change it can lead to all sorts of emotional issues. It is definitely something to seek counseling/therapy for.

I wish you all the best."
Where I'm at. Maybe others relate? ,"I'm in my mid 30s and feel like since my mid 20s life just became meaningless. You lose your dreams because you become to old and the chances go. 

Life for 10 years has just been a constant cycle of bad depression and just existing in a loop. No matter what I do, nothing brings happiness and makes the misery go away. Doesn't matter what I attain, better job, a home etc. I just feel like the best years have gone because youth has gone and now I'm in a really long decline until I get old and die. 

It just feels like all it's about us going to work, earning money, spending the money, dealing with life's bs, repeat. There is nothing left to look forward to, things have all been done and experienced. All life is is filing a void with consumption until the time comes when it ends. 

I just don't understand or see the point. I don't bother even trying to attain a relationship anymore because I know all I can bring is misery and boredom because I can't seem to enjoy much and there isn't anything I really feel like I wanna to go attain anymore, as getting older sucks.

Life really is for the young. Things are new then, you can dream, hope, and with that you can give your life meaning because you are naive enough to be able to do that. As you get older that goes and you are no longer relevant because society values youth and you go on the scrap heap once you leave that category of being young. ",Nah im 14 and i can relate im an bum just rotting in my room doing nothing i have passion but cant execute it im an shitty person to my mom and tbh i dont want to.you aint alone
"Have been struggling all my life and recently have gotten extremely depressed and feeling like death is the only out. I’ve been thinking this a lot but having a hard time with it. Woke up this morning and realized, I don’t want to die, but it feels like I have to. Wut does this mean?","I can't stand how I look-
Just woke up & stumbled to the bathroom and I saw this bloated face with huge uneven under eye bags from a night of crying. My hair has been thinning especially after chronic TE & I lifted my front hair and saw how deep the hairloss was. I'm a female, and the corner edge went back like 3 inches- almost 1/3 of my head. It looked autrocioasly ugly. I couldn't believe it & felt so disappointed. Almost like I'd been hoping to like my appearance today & feel a sense of hope that would justify my esisteabcs or self worth & was let down, which is when I had my realization. 

I looked ugly and it highlighted the boxy look of my face shape & feature placement I hate. 

On top of this my family is toxic & I can't stand them I've always been bad at connecting with people and have no talents.

I love myself, I've never given up on myself and I feel like an introspective creative & special person. 
But I'm so done feeling like this and I know there's probably nothing I can do. 

 I looked in that mirror and felt sadness because I wanted something in me to hold onto and value because the truth is I don't want to go.
But I found the opposite of that & now I'm lost.",I feel the same way about myself.
I’m losing everything,"I’ve lost the ability to plan properly, I’ve lost the ability to follow a schedule, I’ve lost the ability to feel, I’ve lost the ability to do my work, I’ve lost the ability to solve problems, and now I’m losing my ability to think, it feels like my brain is starting to go blank, I used to be able to at least think and think about life and whatever. Now even that is disappearing what should I even do now?",Go day by day. I had a brain trauma a few years ago and when I forget things I get frustrated. I still have problems and depression but I still keep on going.
Help me,"I’ve been stuck in a depressive state since I was 15.. its been getting worse every year and I feel like this is it. I’ve seen a therapist but I can’t afford it anymore. I’ve been on medication and it made me feel completely numb, and my therapist is the one who prescribed it to me. I’ve struggled with anorexia and that adds up to this. 
I cry every day alone in my room when I have to act like I’m okay and happy around the people I’m with.

Yesterday was especially hard because it was Thanksgiving and I had to force a smile on my face around the people I love knowing what’s really going on in my head. When I got home from Thanksgiving, I cried in my moms arms, begging her to hug me and she didn’t know that I tried to take my life the day before until I told her because I never leave my room unless I work. At that point I felt so bad for the times I treated my mom poorly just because I wanted her to see that I do need help. She left for a trip and I feel as if she’s the only one who can help me but now I’m alone and I feel so empty, I just want someone to hug me. She told my dad who was never in my life that I had attempted and he finally decided to break no-contact after years. It made me realize he only cares when it’s too late.

I’ve told my best friend but she disregards what I say because she is busy with her own life and mental health so I don’t want to be a burden. I just want someone to help me because I can’t help myself.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I want all the pain and thinking to go away but no matter how much I try to distract myself, when I’m alone in my room, I can’t help but look at what life could be without me. 
I have a dead-end job, I live with my mom, I have no friends who I feel like genuinely like me and I usually have to pay for them when we go out so it feels like I pay for friends, I have no love life, I feel like I have no future. I had to get an animal to hold me accountable for living and she is the only thing that’s keeping me here. 

I can’t stop crying at the end of the day when I’m alone. I tried to do things that made me happy but I don’t see life the way it used to be before my mental health got so bad. I’ve always implied I needed help to my friends but they always thought it was a joke because I always make them laugh. I really can’t do this any more","Nothing is “wrong” with you. What you are facing is the result of indifference and reality. You are not being a burden to anyone and if your parents say so, they need to treat you better. No one should face what you are going through. Even though I haven’t gone through this depressive state, what I do know is this: social interaction is key. Friends and family are what keep you going.

my boyfriend has mdd,"my boyfriend has major depressive disorder and ocd with chronic migraines. he’s also trans. he’s having the hardest time right now… we have been to ER’s, inpatient, outpatient stays, rehab, and several therapists. 

we are currently attempting to obtain ECT, we have to first establish a primary however and then find a psychiatrist for a referral. however he’s claiming he’s completely done and is at his wits end. “there’s no help right now” but we are 13 days out from a primary physician appointment. 

idk what the f to do. we are both college students so winter break is coming up… and i’m in therapy so i know what a doctor would tell me to do and for him to do…. does he need to stay more occupied? are there things he needs to do? 

i know you can’t make someone want something, but i guess any thoughts would help from other people who understand ","It seems you've tried almost everything so it's kinda hard to give useful advice. But just in case, the best solution I've found to keep my mental stress at bay is physical stress. 

Morning runs might be the best advice but l don't really like people so I do midnight runs. Maybe you guys can go start working out together. 

I've found that the more sore I get the better I feel mentally. Again, it's not much but hope it helps"
Forgotten ,"I hate how easily forgotten I am, no one called or messaged me yesterday. I still have a sister, mother, and grandparents.

i’m so lost,"i’m 18f and survived human trafficking, it continued until i was around 14 years old. I (barely) graduated in may of this year with a below average gpa and got into one school which i currently attend.

i’ve done all of the “healing” things everyone  from my doctors to family members have recommended. started therapy, got diagnosed w a laundry list of things, got medicated, tried to find friends, even got an emotional support dog who i love more than anything in the world


but now that im in college im beginning to realize how behind i really am. i never got any of those important socialization skills or develop those life long interests or hobbies most people have. about a month into my classes i realized i have no real passion, no dream job, not even a field of study i really want to pursue in general.

i’ve never been given a chance to “explore” i guess. the “real world” makes me so incredibly uncomfortable. i think im too behind on normal people things to live any sort of meaningful life. the medication has helped a little but taking medication is useless if my life is no different before or after i take it. i’m the same futureless person just slightly less anxious. 

 i’m just at a lost as to what i could possibly do. any sort of suggestion or advice, anything i haven’t already heard, would be appreciated.","I knew someone who had the same experience as you, they tried everything everyone recommended, went to therapy, group sessions, etc. They also didn’t do great in education, sadly, he didn’t make it. However, through his experience, I can tell you the happiest time he had was with friends. Please socialize with others. However, if this genuinely doesn’t work. I want you to be happy to be yourself. Accept yourself for who you are. Accept that you might not be as academically gifted as others. Find others that accept you for who you are. This might sound cheesy, but if you find these individuals, they won’t fail you. Good luck and stay strong."

I hate seeing everyone else being so open about their feelings when I can't say a word.,"They talk 24/7 about being depressed and suicidal and all the stuff you'd expect, while I have to keep up this stupid act, pretending like I'm fine and that I don't understand their problems, and making completely sure that no one has any reason to care or worry about me at all, when that's all I want. I just want people to know, but I can't let anyone know, because I know the consequences. I fucking hate myself, I can't bear to exist alongside myself, I'm a disgusted, useless, unhelpful, miserable, worthless prick. I'm not suicidal, but in recent times, I've had at least a few moments in which if I had the option to just stop living on the spot, I would have taken it without a second thought. I'm a horrible person, and I just can't be assed to live right now.","I'm open about it online but in real life I don't say a word because simply I don't wan't to. Why would I wan't to lay all my burden on someone else for the sake of feeling a relief? That is egoistic in my opinion, I wan't others to be happy and not miserable like me, that would make me even more miserable. I would never ever wish that someone would experience this what I'm experiencing right now."
How do I convince my depressed husband to get the help he needs?,"I’ve been with my husband for 7 years now. He’s always been a fun, goofy guy but within the last few years his mental health has dropped significantly. Between self-loathing, lack of interest from his mother, and job evaluations, and autism, he’s becoming more and more depressed. I’ve tried to talk to him countless times to try therapy or meditation, but he refuses outright to look for a therapist because he doesn’t think it’ll work. Any suggestions of looking into getting a doctor or meditation just fades out to a “I’ll try” but ultimately never happens. Now he’s starting not to tell me anything because the last thing he wants to do is hurt me and ruin my day, when I’ve told him telling me what’s going on in is head is the only way I can help him, regardless of my feelings. Now I find out that he’s been self harming. The relationship we have is now so draining on me that I’m starting to lose love for him, and I hate myself for feeling that way because he’s implied I’m the only thing good in his life…and it sounds suicidal. It hurts so much to see him this way, but I’m not a professional so I don’t know how to get across that he needs help. Maybe there’s something I could say in the right order that will convince him he needs more help and support besides me. Any advice is deeply appreciated.","Im so sorry to hear what you are going through. Having depression myself, sometimes the despair really clouds any source of hope. Maybe try talking to a therapist on ways to convince ppl? Also, if it works, maybe you could convince him that there is no harm in trying to see of therapy will work. Sometimes it’s really the guilt that prevents us from seeking help, but if there is a way for u to convince him that, maybe thats an avenue u can explore."

Numb,"I hate that I can just be numb at the drop of a hat. I was diagnosed with BPD years ago but It had gotten better once I left a relationship I was in

I was mostly struggling with depression and anxiety but since then I've gotten into another relationship.

It was all fine until recently where it seems like I will just flip from happy to numb multiple times a day. I'm worried my partner doesn't understand and is thinking I'm lazy and good for nothing - that my life growing up is why i don't do anything. I know I am capable of doing work and everything - but I always fall short and fall into this depression/ numb back and forth..

I guess this was just to vent. I just am sick of being so numb and worthless.","Talk to your partner, if they don’t understand- do they deserve you? Cling on to your friendships like your life depends on it; it does. Socialize, befriend, accept yourself, survive. Stay strong, live long."

how do everyone get things done when your depression is bad?,"How do everybody overcome the challenge of finishing big tasks while struggling from depression? 

I'm currently in year 13/seniors and I take classes from an online school. Although now is a very important time since I have finals coming up in next may, my depression is worsening and I'm rotting in bed everyday. Its also rly hard having a mother that calls me lazy in stead of trying to understand mental illness (she doesnt even want to take me to therapy or psychiatrist so I haven't been professionally diagnosed but I'm sure my symptoms come from depression or bipolar). 

  
If theres anything you do to stay motivated and stop zoning out all the time I'd love to know.","There’s no motivation, I just do things to not be homeless. 

Fully accepted life is just like this forever. Hope and desire just make things hurt more."

Tips to control mood?,"I get really bad mood swings all the time. I obsess over self harm. I hate the world around me but like strangers. It gets so bad, my bp fluctuates and I either get seizures, faint, migraines or all 3. My anger issues are through the roof. Any tips to regulate these tendencies?","I think you should check a doctor,as you have BP fluctuations.
Are you having your meals properly?
Are you in constant high-stress situations?
More often than not ,our mind is related to our body.
The world is not a beautiful place,true that.
But you can make your own world-people around you,your hobbies,your desk etc.
I understand the obsession over self harm,but try to understand that if you harm yourself,you are inflicting twice the pain upon yourself.
And try to do things that make you genuinely happy,like you want to do it.
This's my two cents,hope it helps!"

Would anyone care?,"So basically I(f) was sick off school today and I received exactly 0 texts at all and I genuinely think no one noticed at all.

Antidepressant advice ,I’ve been thinking about getting on anti depressants to numb emotions. Does anyone regret getting use to the feeling of having your emotions numb?

And id rather just deal with the rawness of emotional pain if that means I get to by pass withdrawal and dependency ,"No, when you take antidepressant, the effect is temporary anyway."

more angry than sad ,"recently, i think my depression has been presenting itself more as anger and irritability than sadness. i thought i was getting better because i haven’t been as sad, but then i realized that i’m just angry, bitter, jealous, irritable all the time. i’m not currently on medication but i took fluoxetine (prozac) at one point. should i look into taking it again or will it not be the best to help with anger? any tips or suggestions help. thanks!

Depression is not just a ethereal thing. It is a set of neurological and nervous system processes. 

Look it this way if the software or hardware on your computer wasn't working well you would expect glitches, crashes, things slowing down etc.

Whilst the mind, brain and body is not a computer...they do need the physical, mental and emotional nourishment and nurturing to work together.

Look up how depression affects memory. Researching and learning about depression from evidence based research to build a path towards a happier and healthier existence."

 Now that I think of it, I can barely remember what I did this year.","Hi, what you're describing can definitely be linked to depression. It often affects memory, focus, and our sense of time, making events feel blurred or closer than they actually are. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

**1. It's Common:** You’re not alone in feeling this way. Depression can make the passage of time seem distorted.

**2. Small Steps Help:** Keeping a journal or planner can help you track events and create a clearer sense of time.

**3. Focus on the Present**: Engaging in mindfulness activities can help ground you in the moment and improve awareness.

**4. Reach Out:** Talking to a mental health professional can provide tools to navigate this and address the underlying feelings.

Be kind to yourself—what you’re experiencing is valid, and it’s okay to seek support!"

Quickest example I can give: I was at the doctor yesterday getting an antidepressant/anti-anxiety drug refill and I said something like ""I was here a couple of months ago to see (alternate doctor) about this medication."" Doctor: ""That was June."" 

I think part of it is probably also that being thoroughly depressed AND attempting for months to get another job means days can easily run together. I'm doing a lot of the same things each day. It's such a crazy feeling when you feel like a year went by in a few months - and this feels a hundred times worse if you've been really struggling psychologically across time, as you can feel like you don't have good things to mention when looking at the ""lost period."""

 Now that I think of it, I can barely remember what I did this year.","This is coming from a good place, with depression causing time to move by either very quickly or very slowly, depending on the situation, but time feels like it speeds up as we grow older, not because of stress or anxiety, but because when you are say, 5 years old, a year is literally a fifth of your entire Life, so it feels like a long time. Meanwhile, when you're 20, that same year is only a 20th of your total Life, so it doesn't feel as long. By the time you're 80, a year is barely a fraction of your Life. Time dilates as we age because, from our standpoint, each day is a smaller and smaller total of our experience, thus each day feels like a smaller and smaller blip in the grand scheme of things. I remember watching a documentary on the Science channel some 15 years ago which explained this a lot better, but that's the gist of it."

Cry for Help.,Today I visited a doctor about my depression and was told I had to wait several weeks to see a specialist. I couldn’t wait any longer. I took a 1 hour walk and ended up staring at a busy road. I wanted to jump infront of the cars and end it there but I fucking froze. Im so pathetic I don’t even have the courage to kill myself. ,I’m also too pathetic to kill myself. I think its because my mind somewhere still keeps hope that one day things will get better.
I am done with life and I don't know how to deal with self hatred.,"I truly despise myself and I don't know how to deal with it other than self harm. I used to burn myself before and it felt amazing the pain being there for days was a good thing. I tried to get rid of this piece of shit but nothing happened at all I should have increased the dose by a lot. 

So now I don't know what to do, I gave up on everything. I don't want to go to work or do anything, I don't want to find another job, I don't want to study to get a better job, I don't want to travel to find a better life, I don't want to try anything anymore. 

I don't want anything. I am just done. ",Feel the same.
Tired,"I’ve just been waking up so tired. I’m alone, no one ever seems to stay. They just get tired of me and leave. I start to tear myself apart. I’m exhausted everyday. I’m tired trying to distract myself. I’m tired ",I’m here if you need someone to talk to
How do i stop thinking of girls or friends as the only goal in life? ,"I feel like i have to be perfect to achieve these, have a great personality, have a lot to offer, have a lot of positive qualities 

I feel desperate to get these to prove that ""im good enough"" or ""worthy"" and if i dont achieve those i feel ""worthless"" 

I dont like that its always me chasing, instead of forming genuine connections im after their approval validation attention. 

I dont blame people for not caring, why would they chase or put effort into someone who's boring? Doesnt have a lot to offer? Is negative? Is only talking to them to ""get something from them"" like filling a void or using them as a way to boost ego or be used as a replacement for my self esteem. 

And im constantly basing my self worth/happiness on external factors, i lose one game in a video game? I feel worthless, i text a girl and doesnt reply? I feel worthless, this makes me get into a deep cycle of self criticism and self doubt, that ""i cant do anything right"" 

Im constantly in performance or entertainer mode. Like a monkey trying to make others happy, putting them on a pedestal just so they dont leave or ignore. Fear of rejection and abandonment and if these happen i feel ""worthless"" 

Its never me who's being chased, liked, cared about. I always chase. 

I know that if someone likes me, or enjoys my company, or wants to be in my life i wont have to always chase them, or make it a battle to stay with them or pressure them. 
","Until 2018 I believed in one and only truth which society tried to thrust into my head - that there is no other way than being an extroverted social creature. I was never liked because I couldn't fit into society and trying so hard to fit in wasted half of my huge potential. It was tough time because in 2016 my depression kicked in and nothing was right. I had no hobbies and it was the main problem I had that lead me to loneliness and the wrong belief I mentioned earlier, but then I found hobbies and I started to sit in home all time when I wasn't in school.  
  
I realized that having friends is not necessary to feel good and I actually feel better alone because people were one of main causes to my depression and feeling bad overall, around this time I started heavily educating myself and developing even heavier, after that I realized fast enough that my current ""friends"" were fake and dumb as fuck so I cut them off, not to mention that I cut all people besides them and it wasn't like those all people were around me because they liked me.

Since 2018 I gradually started to refuse all ***social*** rules only sustaining my own set of rules. Now, I know that people and social connections are not needed to anything in life and I laugh loudly when someone says different shit because despite that I lived in self-isolation a couple of years I'm the most eloquent guy around and I have no problems contacting with people."

Been lonely all my life ,"I 18F have really never really had any friends, I’d always wait for the next stage of my life to make a friend e.g. in primary i realised I was lonely so waited until secondary school to make friends but then waited until college but I never made anyone. I still had people to talk to but they’d mainly talk to me about how good of a friend they are with other people and this honestly brings me so much pain. It’s not like I don’t like anyone but it seems everyone meshes so well yet I fail to connect with anyone, my interests are completely different, I like completely off things as well. I tried joining societies but there was no luck in that. I went to see a doctor in hopes to get medication for my feelings as I’m in college now and although I’ve finally accepted I’m almost destined to be lonely I live alone so the only feelings I have are of sadness.

You'd be surprised how many good people you may befriend later, outside of school or childhood contexts. Work, sports, hobbies, travel, and even your partner's friends (my best friend is a childhood friend's ex, and they broke up 15 years ago)

The important thing is being ready to open up to others. Sometimes, there isn't much to offer other than being there for them, and that's good enough.
And don't be lazy."
Does depression actualy ever go?,"In my personal experience it feels like since i got depressed it never realy left.


I feel much better than 10 years ago. Ive had lots of psychologists, had to change my life alot. But now i no longer want to kill myself and i rarely have anxiety attacks anymore. Have a job, a house, a relationship. Finances are still low but my life is pretty good now. 


However it feels like my brain has changed since i got heavily depressed at 21. I cant think the way i used to think. In new situations, (mostly very untrue) negative thoughs happen in my head immediately that i just didnt used to think before. I know how to deal with these thoughts now, thanks to the years of help, and can prevent the thoughts from spiralling too much. 
But they always arrive, and i always have to work to keep them in control. 


Ive talked to someone else who has (had?) depression, explained my thoughts on this and he felt the same way.

the endless cycle of shame ,"i’m 21 & i’m trying my best to survive the lowest, darkest time of my life thus far. for the past 3 years, i’ve been stuck in this cycle that i always believe i have finally succeeded in breaking, only to fall back into old habits again, & again, & again. only a few people know im getting bad again. i can’t let my family find out; they’ve tried their hardest to support me but they’d be done with me if they found out because they’re tired of my bullshit. hell, i’m tired of my bullshit. i’m ready to end it all.. but my girlfriend tells me how much she needs me & that she cannot survive without me. it’s really hard for me to believe her, and i don’t know why. my brain just tells me that she’s just saying that to make you feel better. everyone significant in my life has left thus far. i haven’t been able to keep a friendship consistently. i don’t have any friends right now. i wish i had a friend. i’m so grateful to have my girlfriend, she’s all i have right now. she is the light of my life. but all i do is bring her down since im so sad & complaining all the time. i know that she deserves so much better.. & they say if you love something, let it go. right? i don’t want to hold her back by being too much. i know i can be very intense. i feel like there’s no way out of the cycle except dying. i can’t wait for my expiration date. i can’t even stand to live another day having to be in my own body & sit with myself. i hate being myself. i hate myself. i don’t have anything to offer the world. and instead, i drain everyone around me in every way possible & give everyone who comes into my life so much pain and trauma. so, here’s to ending the cycle. i’m praying that my attempt is successful & as painless as possible. i am so grateful to have had the life i’ve had thus far. i hope that everyone in my life makes the happiest memories they can look back on when they’re old & that they’re able to find whatever meaning or fulfillment they’re searching for.. i know i wish i did.

It was cathartic, even more so when we all got it out together. I kind of wish the cops would have shown up for it. Also saw in your comments about a rage room, have done it, would recommend. Especially if you have some personal glass items that represent some form of frustration that you can bring to demolish."

If you think about it, that person did the right thing too. Thinking they were helping someone in need.

Your unique definition of depression??,"Just curious. Mine is starting something like a trip or multiple days off from work and already thinking about the last day/knowing what the last day of it will be like. Like ""what's the point"" kind of thing. So it's not just simply like ""post-movie depression"" or whatever coz that's different.",Mine is going throughout the day and life as normal not sharing with anyone how much I’m hurting and instead coming to Reddit. I need therapy but it doesn’t do anything. No therapy has ever helped so I give up on therapy. I give up on wasting everyone’s time and money for something that doesn’t do any good for me. I’m not in it to help myself. I’m in it to get shit off my chest cause I can’t bring it up to anyone I care about. So lately. I’ve just been going about my day and acting like I’m fine. Like I’m not dying. Or dreading life. Like I’m not lonely or depressed. Like I’m not wanting to die at all. I just have this mask that no one sees past cause no one really cares. And I truly believe no one actually cares about me. Cause peioke who care talk to the people they care about. They don’t leave them on delivered all day. Or leave them on read. They reach out first. They sends well wishes on holidays. But no one does that for me. I wished a friend happy thanksgiving yesterfsy and they didn’t even say it back. I got no texts from anyone else with the wishes. I got left on read wishing another person happy thanksgiving. So honestly. I’m really honing on: “2025 is the year the I give up on social life”. Where I don’t have any close friends. Where I don’t text first. Where I stop going out. I stop trying. I stop texting I stop calling. I get cold. And no one will fucking care one iota. And I’m doing it cause I know I can get away with it. I know I can force myself to die alone. I think maybe being alone is better than being with people who dont actually care. I’m done feeling lied to. I’m done with the empty promises. The rejection. If anyone wants me. They need to pursue me. 2025 I’m changing myself. Possibly gonna starve myself. Possibly gonna become even more fat. Gonna try to go to the gym more often. It’s a mixture of self care and isolation. But like. Yeah. I give up on my relationships. It’s clear no one’s actually stay so why even bother trying to keep them?

So depression to you is having free time then knowing when you go back you have “life” to deal with. This seems more as a starting point for when your depression kicks in. I’ve had a similar situation where I feel my lowest just before the end of a semester knowing I’ll have a break. So quite the opposite of yours. I’ll be depressed on trips or taking a break. Certainly mine is performative  based. Or it will be after a time of putting too much on my plate and I break, again performative based."

Its life and first glance you cant tell the difference but key elements are missing.
Like imagine you have an issue on the trial versiob beating a level or something and everyobe says to just use a function you cant access unless you're on the full version. 
Therapists tell me to just do things i enjoy until i'm fed up and leave. Issue is everything i do gives me nothing or i get so enveloped i forget to eat or sleep and they act as if i'm doibg this on purpose. 
I go there because i cant live like this and i stop going wondering if they only treat healthy or normal people, if not even trained professionals can help me there really is no hope, my life was bricked or imherently flawed from the start"
I don’t know how much longer i can hold on,"I don’t know if i can handle life anymore. I don’t really have anything to live for at this point. no friends, very minimal family and the love of my life has broken up with me. I feel like my entire existence has been one punch after another and the moment i manage to stand up again and continue to fight im thrown back to the floor. I’ve lost my job too so i have no income and no way to support myself for the first time in my life and i feel like a complete failure. I’m barely holding on i just sleep all day and cry all night. nothing helps. nothing makes this go away even for a single second. I know the little family i do have would be devastated if i left but i don’t know how much longer i can hold on. i’m broken.","It sounds like you're having a really bad time in your life. I think anyone would be ""broken"" after breaking up and losing their job. I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling so much and I think it's normal to be depressed about your life considering your situation, but please consider reaching out to the little family you have for support. Hold on a bit for them."

Feel like I'm a different species,"Been at my job for almost two years and haven't made any friends or even acquaintances. We've never had any arguments but I wouldn't say I'm friends with any of them, we only talk when it's absolutely necessary to the task at hand. We get a fair amount of people leaving and new people coming in and the new people always fit in immediately. 

I don't know if it's because I look pissed off and/or sad all the time or what but I feel like everyone avoids me and looks at me weird, like I'm some pathetic little creature, not human. I just wonder what's the point if my whole life I'm always going to be treated less than human, it was like this as a child and it's still like this an adult :| 

Also when I do have a rare conversation with someone it's like I'm acting, pretending to be this funny, happy guy instead of being my true self because I know they'll like me more if I'm not me. When I'm not acting I'm a meek little shell of a person nobody would want to be around.

Just wanted to vent :)","lol same, it feels like every interaction from the womb has been me pretending. I’ve mastered the art of wearing my sanity convincingly enough to appear human. I don’t think I’ve ever genuinely connected with another soul or had a meaningful conversation, just fluff."

Life is definitely cruel. ( Sensitive subject ),"What do you do when you feel alone? When you realize that your whole life you have been and always will be alone?

Extreme Brain Fog. Where do I go from here?,"Long story short, I lived like a bum for the past few months. Isolated myself and became a recluse. Day and night just on my phone, doing nothing. I managed to secure an internship through an old friend even though I’d been doing nothing the past few months. A few weeks before this occurred however, I realised that my brain was absolute mush.

No cognition. No coordination. Can’t remember anything, even things told to me 30 seconds before. No range of vocabulary. No sense of punctuation. Can’t type on pc or phone properly anymore. When I say my cognition is non-existent, I mean it. I’m constantly saying the wrong things in my head. Don’t use my common sense when it comes to the most basic things. Can’t recognise jokes/satire anymore. Sound like an npc in conversation because I’ve got nothing to say or my brain simply can’t keep up with it. I feel like whoever I talk to in real life about this doesn’t understand the full extent of it. 

What do I do? My brain’s fried from all the dopamine seeking activities I’ve indulged myself in the past year. The past few years if I’m being honest with myself. Can anyone who’s gone through the same thing give me any advice. I couldn’t even work at my shitty part time job for a full shift because I realised that I couldn’t recall anything. Even my therapist doesn’t understand how bad it’s gotten.  ","It may be difficult to give coherent advice for your condition because it may be organic or neurological, so you may have to see a specialist doctor and of course not a therapist. In general, I will speak based on my experience only. During the pandemic, I was very inactive, and when I returned to study, I noticed a significant decline in my mental abilities to the point that I feared that my brain had broken down. It is good that the brain is sufficiently stabilised to adapt and repair itself. Think of it as an athlete who stopped practicing for years and then returned. He will feel that he lost a lot, but with persistence and exercise, he may return to what he was. If your brain becomes weaker in certain matters, exercise it. For example, if you find yourself bad at memorising and remembering, allocate an hour a day to practicing memory exercises. By the way, you write much better than the impression you describe seems!"

During this time I’d repeatedly cuss myself out for past decisions, yet would rinse and repeat the same bummy routine I’d set up. I’m 99% sure my brain atrophied and killed off neurons crucial for concentration, problem solving etc.,"

I don't know how you judged that there is damage to your brain that cannot be repaired. The brain is a stronger organ than you can imagine and has tremendous flexibility to recover even from the removal of part of it. Some brain cancer patients suffer severe damage to the point that they lose entire areas of the brain, for example the area responsible for hearing, but the brain, with its flexibility, adapts and the person regains his hearing through another area. I understand your fear and pessimism about the mental state you are going through, but it is only current and treatment and development are possible. You can practice mental exercises or see a neurologist to give you advice and a more accurate treatment plan."

It's a bitch and a half. 

As for social anxiety, I get it too. When I was in college my major required me to do a lot of speaking in front of groups. I'd get such bad tunnel vision, but over time I started getting better at presenting myself as more confident. Does your school have anything you can join that involves groups? That's a good way to practice and get used to talking in front of others. 

I bombed my first job interview too. i was so nervous  and messed up when talking to them. Just know that they expect you to be nervous. I've now interviewed several people for jobs (I'm 32) and nervousness isn't an issue. What matters is can you do the job, because you're going to be much more relaxed when you're hired and working."

I've always recommended that people interview for jobs / companies they don't want to work for at first. That way if you bomb it due to a bad interview, it's not really a huge loss.

I’ve found a couple of things have helped significantly to reduce my porn intake. Whenever you get a urge to watch porn like in the morning or at night due to habit, pull up a video and watch it without actually doing the deed. This will help satiate your dopamine urges. Next you mentioned social anxiety. I would suggest a great degree of introspection as why you feel anxious. Do you feel that others are judging you? Do you feel like you’re not enough? With any addiction, the drug of choice which in this case porn, fixes all those problems temporarily. It eases your mind and helps you to forget your issues. I would also suggest working out if you’re not already doing so. Having a great goal as well to improve on like reducing your social anxiety can be achieved through small steps like going to a coffee shop in public and just reading. Complimenting strangers, initiating a short conversation, going to a party etc. Hope this helps"

I hate how much mental illness had robbed from me,"I know I'm capable of being liked, loved, and improvement. But geuninely some days I'm like barely hanging on a thread trying not to kill myself. I feel like I should be out there with my friends partying and going to shows. Maybe even try dating. Try harder to get a job. But I'm rotting in bed, staring at my screen trying to finish college hw. I am receiving therapy and psychriatic help just, it's slow. I'm lonely and I don't see my friends often due to the fact it takes all my energy to go to my 1 in person class. I do talk to people but, I've been told I look like pathetic. Like it's very clear I'm depressed and sad. And when I'm in my severe depressive episodes, it's geuninely so hard to to talk to people sometimes. I stutter and avoid eye contact because I'm so tired. Every word feels like pulling teeth even though I want to talk to people. It's kinda the rule of life that you gotta be friendly and somewhat upbeat to attract people and I pretty much lack any of that these days. I used to be able to do it but I'm so tired.","I understand. Depression and anxiety robbed two years of my life in college. I managed to survive courtesy of writing and literature (and eventually support from family and friends -- to whom I owe far too much.) Still, the feeling persists; those days of physically forcing myself to leave bed in the morning to attend a three-fucking-hour lecture I couldn't be arsed to attend never leave me.

I have to rely on my husband a lot financially and I absolutely dislike it because I miss having my own money to do whatever I want with. It also makes me want to stay in and not see friends either.

Like some people have the gift of the gab and some of people are more reserved (especially in group settings). I love talking to strangers/different types of people now, and it youst to literally be my worst fear but it's really kinda interesting and exciting.... Now I've gotten over my unrealistic expectations of myself and the fear of not being liked. Who wants to be like by everyone anyway! You should just care about liking yourself. 

I caused a lot of my own misery trying to fit into what other people wanted me to be. It's horrible and unattainable and ruins your ability to love and like the person you are. Your your own person and you can be socially awakward there's nothing wrong with that... In my opinion we need more silly, goofy, awkward people haha!!!

Don't let yourself feel worthless, your not, changing your perspective can take time but don't give up your 100% not alone.

Even just saying you feel like you wish you had spent your time different shows you have grown and aren't the same person as before. Be kind to yourself we're all human.

(also I envied all of my more social friends lifestyles, but whenever I actually went out to a nightclub/rave I never enjoyed it - tuns out it wasnt for me anyway, after all the pain I put myself through for not being part of it!!)"

Getting rejected sucks,As you can tell by the title. I made the mistake of asking a woman out for the first time since 2016. Someone I thought I could trust. She literally said no and that she already got what she wanted from me. I never thought my father would have been right. Turns out he wasn't lying when he said to me that everyone you will ever meet is temporary. So somehow I found myself sitting in this house alone unable to sleep or even think clearly. And honestly between what that woman said and the voice of my father ringing out in my head i feel numb. ,Hi friend. I have thought about the idea of that everyone is temporary. Is a sad idea that I even struggle with. Heartbreaks are awful but needed to help to protect us from more hurt. Keep working on yourself and don’t let someone take your power from you. Love you
In a rough rut,"I can't relate anymore. I feel like i truly don't belong here or anywhere in the grand scheme of things. I'm overthinking if my english is bad. (english isnt my first language). Suffered memory loss when i was in my worst depressive phase. Shit me, I feel stupid and unintelligent. I never initiated anything, heck this my first time posting   here. My underdeveloped social skills combined with my anxiety leads to an eventful cascade of negative emotions. Been lonely most of my life but gotten used to it. My initial goal right now is to break out of my shell, though fear is the thing holding me back. Well i've got almost nothing else to lose here.

I’m having a horrible day at work realize I been in the same department and I suck at it for the last 3 years . I looked up guns and I called my mom and said I wish I could blow out my brains . Quick note I tried when I was 18 or 19 . She said she didn’t want to hear about it . I’m a failure at everything in life . It’s been 20 years and I do not understand why the bullet missed ","Firstly, you're not shit at your job, you wouldn't be employed if you were shit. I know how you feel though, I felt like I was shit at my job for years until I finally convinced myself I'm not shit. 

I'm sorry your mother didn't want to hear it, no person should be told that by their own parent. Similarly but also quite different, I was dismissed twice today when I tried to talk about it with some friends/colleagues. It does hurt, especially when you've offered an ear to them in the past. 

I'm sure you have somebody who will listen, but if you feel you don't, you have this community who will listen."

My children getting older is killing me. ,"Watching my children grow is a blessing and a curse. I love seeing them grow but my depression keeps me awake at night and sad all day thinking about how fast they are growing up before my eyes and how I'll never get this time back.

How to know when you have depression? ,I don't know if I do have depression. I haven't consult any psychiatrist yet but is being lonely without reason and for some random times could be a symptom for depression? ,"It's always important to go first for help, a professional it's going always to be better. But I used to have some years ago, and it can go under the table, you need to notice those small symptoms, I used to feel that loneliness, and it grew for a long time. Glady I went to someone who could help, and being able to see those small things, it's key"

Thanks!","First off, you’re not a bother. TBH I’m not the best to ask. I get it that sometimes we feel happier, complacent, even more comfortable when given a reason we can’t succeed beyond our control. Do you really feel better? Honest because if yes then you’re standing in your own way and are just scared to feel this new sense of reality. You can grow and learn anything you want to. The limit is how passionate you are. Everyone feels these things different. To me it’s sounds like you are either adjusting and need to take time for yourself in whatever way works best for you, or you are self sabotaging. I personally have no idea how bpd works so I couldn’t tell you based on that diagnosis though"

Why did I fail those classes, because I just couldn’t get out of bed. So I get some of what you’re feeling but mistakes are good. Some cost more than others and All of them feel huge but mistakes give you the opportunity to learn and grow. Failing will always happen when in pursuit of something."

idk how to stop myself from not doing anything ,"this whole bedrotting “trend” makes me mad because i’ve struggled with it for so long and it really puts everything in perspective. i dont understand how no matter how much i try to be better, i always find myself in my bed. i cannot leave, it has gotten to a point where half of my “golden years” are lost in the folds of my blanket. i miss out on almost every outing, party, event, and so so so many school days. i often just brush it off as a break from life but its been years and i cant change no matter what i do. i’ve lived life so sad, that whenever i do actually get out of my room (hardly ever), i think about the fastest way i could get to my room. i wanna live life and i wanna be happy but it seems like no matter what i do, i just wanna stay in bed and never leave. doesn’t help that im so antisocial. i loathe any position that requires me to talk to other people. i missed a conference meeting for a competition for like $3000 usd that i had multiple ideas for and i backed out because it required me to go out to crowded places and interview random people with my teammates. i just wanna be a normal 16 yo girl and enjoy life. ",I’m the same way on days I try to get out of my room I want to be in it in bed eating or scrolling/watching tv. I’m also broke so i just stay in my room all day long I’ve also gotten fat because I eat in bed and sleep all day.

I hate how depression is eating away at my motivations and aspirations.,"I used to be driven once. I'm not the same anymore.

I have a certain project with a friend. We are working on an album to establish us as a pop music duo. 

I am also learning how to play keys(I can compose but can't play). I will also take up singing so to support him as a backup singer(he's the main performer). 

I would love to do all this, but I feel so empty and worthless inside. I scared of results. I am scared of failure. Worst of all, I feel numb.

I try to motivate myself by visualising the songs. But I can't motivate myself.

I want to do regular and consistent work. Basically get into a flow state. But depression is a bitch.","Depression is a horrible bitch.

What helps me is to think of flowers/plants. 

It's cheesy but it's true.

Nothing blooms all year.

Plants can thrive in different environments.

A fir tree can stay relatively the same through all weathers even in cold countries that will kill other plants

Cacti can last in weathers others won't

Then there are climates that eb and flow, the trees will die and come back to life each few months.

What the plant is and what climate it's in will change when and by how much and for how long the plant blooms. 

Some people will be okay with the eb and flow of their life, where others will want to be a fir tree or a cactus, they will want stability throughout. 

For that though they have to go to a climate that is different.

We have the ability to move <3 

But either way, it makes me feel better. Feeling up and down is part of nature. I hope you are okay and, if not this, you find something that brings you comfort.

<3"
Told my parents about my attempt,"This monday I sat down with my parents and I told them about my attempt earlier this year, I told them that every day I contemplate if I should go through with it and try again. They immediately got me help and such, but I don't really care about any of that. I've seen my mother cry, but her crying while making me promise not to kill myself was way different. My father just seemed shocked and didn't really cry, until today. He broke down in front of me and started crying, I didn't feel the same as when my mother cried. I've never seen my dad cry, telling me how powerless he felt, not being able to help me at all. 

The worst part of it all is that I didn't cry in both instances, even when they were hugging me and I felt the tears in my neck. I couldn't, nor did I even feel much at all. I knew that I cared, but I didn't feel the feeling that I was supposed to be feeling. 

","Try not to judge yourself on the feelings you felt at that moment. There isn't a standard feeling that you should have had in that moment and feeling what seems like ""nothing"" is absolutely ok.


The way you process feelings in any particular moment is truly individual so don't second guess yourself.


I think it's good that you could share your troubles with your parents and hopefully you'll be able to tackle this together as a team. They will obviously need some time to comes to terms with their emotions as this would have come as a shock to them.


I hope it all works out for the best and I'm sending my best wishes to all of you."

I wish I could just disappear,"I wish I could disappear from my life. Wish it could be easy to just pack up and leave the life I have right now and go somewhere else and start new. It's just that my issues will follow me where ever I go and a change in scenery is a temporary band aid solution. Feels hard to care anymore and am I'm tired of fighting sadness, loneliness and depression. I'm not suicidal, thankfully, but I wish I could just disappear",Me too I’m in a deep depression where I’m rotting in bed every chance I get because I don’t want to do anything else. I’m also struggling financially and I’m turning to food to cope so I’ve gotten fat as well.
I feel lost and uninterested in life,"Everyday feels like it’s just like the next, all the days blend together and life doesn’t really have joy, at least not for very long. I can’t really imagine myself in a future, just sorta stop existing. I can imagine scenarios but when I actually think about my possible future my brain shuts down and reminds me of my complete lack of skills, useable interests, or ambition. Even when I was younger I would just sort of imagine a scenario of the future and when it went into actual practice my brain would go “you won’t be around so who cares” I think I just always assumed I’d kill myself by now and….the years keep coming and life still…hasn’t changed. I’ve gotten some help with depression and my ADHD but ultimately nothings changed, I still feel as lost as I did before ","I feel like most of us are in survival mode, Groundhog Day  vibes basically."

I've done some pretty neat things. There were low points, like really low points. Even this past year sucked but things can be good too. I find solo travel fun, even just driving to a new town and exploring or going to the movies alone. And I have great friends. There's a lot of places I want to see, I want to go see a grizzly bear in Alaska and I want to scuba dive in the coral reefs of Australia. Not sure when I'll be able to but I'm excited for the silly goals. This past summer I saw the northern lights and they were beautiful. Little goals can push you forward."

I think the problem is that my brain can’t even handle the little goals, it changes its mind constantly and without warning and beats on me the second I try and get excited about something. If something involves a lot of effort and work my brain finds all the reasons it can to talk me out of doing it because it doesn’t wanna be disappointed again. It’s why I’ve dropped so many hobbies and such cause the second my brain tries to understand something, if it doesn’t grasp it immediately and do it perfectly, it confirms for itself like “see what did I tell you about trying stuff? You’re just going to fail so stop trying.”"

It took a long time to be good at being bad at things. To laugh when I make a fool of myself. To not be perfect. I go rock climbing and the 8 year olds are better than me. I go hiking and have to ask the group to slow down. I lose every goddamn pickleball game I ever play. But I still do it and I still have fun. Everyone around you doesn't care that you fail, only you do."
Coming back to my childhood bedroom is haunting,"I’m 24, visiting my parents for Thanksgiving. I now live in a different state. They still live in the house I grew up in, and it’s feeling really weird to come back to my old room. When I was in college and came home for breaks, I remember it was comforting to have this familiar space to come back to, a space that gave me that feeling of stability and coziness that dorm life never could. 

Now, it just feels kind of… eerie. I was once a baby in this room. My parents read me picture books on a couch in the corner where my bed now is. I spent hundreds of hours in here playing with various toys, hundreds more lying awake at night as a teenager, thinking about crushes and colleges to consider and ideas for novels I swore I’d write someday. This is where I thought up so, so many hopes and dreams for my future, from big crazy things like maybe making it to Broadway with an original play, to silly teenager things like fooling around with a classmate in a friends-to-lovers sort of scenario (surprise, never happened). 

And now? I’m a different person. I don’t aspire to be anyone, I don’t crave intimacy with others. I don’t have any hopes and dreams. These walls once saw ambition in my eyes, and now I’m just empty, unmotivated, and uninterested in most things, especially things that would be good for me.

I wish I could go back to being the kid who felt like this room was their sanctuary. Instead, I just feel reminded of how much my personality, mental health, and worldview have changed for the worse. And it doesn’t feel like home. And neither does my apartment 600 miles away.","Beautiful, haunting reflection.  That past you is still in you, even though depression has robbed you of your hopes and dreams for now."

I hate being me so much ,"I don’t even know where to start. I stay up far to late very night start school tried as all hell with no energy to do any of my hobbies. I never go out, with friends or in general. My parents got into such a big fight with my ex’s parents that we had to break off an almost year long relationship just before our anniversary. I’m not even sure if I’m a guy. I have no idea what I’m going to do in the future with all the grades I make. It all just becomes more and more hopeless each day. I just want all this shit it be over with. I try and push through every day but it all just feels the same. What’s the point of life without someone to share it with? Without a purpose? Without energy to do anything?","Heyo! I saw you commented on my post so I thought I’d give some advice. I was in the exact same situation as you, just minus the ex part, bed rotted, felt trapped in my own body etc. One thing I did to change my life was taking smol jumps in my life to grow my confidence/self esteem, i can be anything, really, I just tried to make every day a day to get some experience for growing.  Another thing is finding the root of your problems, see what is causing these things to happen in your life, once you’ve found that, try to tweak or change the issues while taking it slow.

For example if someone says anything that sounds like suicidal ideation, there’ll be a wave of people saying you matter, don’t etc. but do any of those people call? Do they stop by? No. They just make a useless post and go on about their day. 

I’ve been going through this with someone extremely close to me and it’s all just words. No action whatsoever. I think that’s a worse feeling than getting no ‘encouragement’ at all."

This resonated with so thought I’d share it,"""I am not well. I could have built the Pyramids with the effort it takes me to cling on to life and reason.""  - Franz Kafka",I feel that.

I don't want to get better anymore,"I don’t want to get better anymore. I’m tired of this  endless fighting with myself, of having to convince myself to face the day and people with a smile on my face. I’m tired of wonderig whether or not I should talk about how I feel and if it will suck the life out of people. I’m tired of hesitating, grabbing my courage and going through with opening up only to be told people are tired of cleaning up my guts. I’m tired of having a good day only to be miserable again, and be blamed for ruining shit. I’m tired of asking for help and not getting it, I’m tired of having to pay to get help. I’m tired of medicating myself to some sort of semblance of joy and find the rug swept under me when something goes wrong. 

I wanted so, so much to get better. And not even for myself. I wanted to get better so **other people** can be more comfortable, can have an easier life not having to think of me. I’m so tired of hearing that I should just get over things and that I overreact and I hate this I hate this I hate this.

I used to be a romantic. I yearned. I wished for better days. I sought greater tomorrows. I strived for a better future. But it just doesn’t come. 

It never gets better. It only gets worse. 

And I feel so, so, so alone. 

I don’t want to waste my remaining energy hoping and trying. 

One day I’ll get the courage, and I’ll leave. I’ll leave and I’ll end this suffering. Maybe not today, but soon.

I couldn't save a kitten. I feel devastated ,"Long story short I found a scared kitten in a parking lot of a grocery store last night. Tried to catch him but he literally jumped out of my hand and ran off. When I came back today I found it dead in the parking lot. I had him in my hands and I decided to try again tomorrow but it was too late.

I'm trying not to blame myself but dammit I should have tried harder. I had to break the news to someone who tried to help and they were heartbroken. I didn't want to talk about it with family at Thanksgiving as I thought no one wanted to hear that. So I suffered alone and ran through every scenario of what I should have done. 

Sorry for this being a mess but so am I at the moment. ","You're a great person for trying and your intentions were nothing but good.

I wish I could but I'm not able to relieve you of the pain you're feeling right now. All I can tell you is to go easy on yourself as much as possible.

Sending you my best wishes."

And on a side note, with winter coming up do remember to honk your horn or slap your hood. Stray cats and kittens do use your car's undercarriage to seek shelter from the cold, which is how the kitten I attempted to rescue lost its life. And I speak not from this experience but this exact scenario happened to my dad when I was a kid. The guilt you feel is beyond words and I don't want anyone to go through that."
I feel like I can’t fit in.,"I feel like I can’t fit in, even In school. when I try to talk to someone, I either stutter or hesitate. I feel very down at myself and I blame myself for not trying. my brain thinks that what I’m doing is wrong or that I would look weird when I talk. Even if I talk my friends wouldnt understand me, I try making friends in classes but they either go with their other friends without me or they look at me weird. I look myself at the mirror to think and think about what I did wrong but I was trying to fit in. Even if I made a friend they would treat me poorly and leave me behind which I go alone. I have special interests which I sometimes watch anime and I usually play games. I try to making people happy and being respectful and kind but I guess they took advantage of my kindness. If I wanted to unfriend my friends who treat me poorly and controlled me, I would be lonely and I would have no one but people with their other friends, I feel like a puzzle piece that is oddly shaped and warped weirdly. ","Sometimes it is scary to speak either for fear of making a mistake or judging you and it is normal to a certain extent but you should try even though at first it will be difficult, you can use questions about a topic or ask for something
At school, groups or friends are mostly made because they have similar tastes and when a person does not share the taste or interest they feel out of place.
Try to find people with similar tastes, whether in games or anime, ask them what anime they saw, what they think about that ending or what character their favorites are, characters that should not have died and that would help you a little to let go and start talking, and at first it will be difficult to find similar people but you can"
Need Advice,"I have been in a rough place for the past year. A lot of things in my life has changed recently and I am unsure of how to accept the past and move on. I am constantly living with guilt and feeling lost in life. As well as having the same intrusive thoughts everyday, which makes it hard to function. I have been in therapy for the past couple weeks and found out that I have mild depression, which was not a surprise. Therapy has helped me gain a little hope that things will get better and to change my mindset to focus on the good things, rather than the bad. I won’t get into everything because it is a lot and I think you get the picture.

Anyways, I have made the decision multiples times to prioritize my mental health. I try to engage in activities that I enjoy, like thrifting. I know that my thoughts are just thoughts and I try not to respond to them. I will do good most of the day, especially when I am focused on doing something. However, there will be periods (typically at night) where the guilt comes back and makes me feel as though I am not making any progress with my mental health. This is mainly because I notice that the intrusive thoughts are still wandering in my mind. It makes me feel like I am back at square one and I can’t help but think that I am “wasting my time” and not healing from my past.

I guess I am looking for advice on how to stay positive even when I have bad moments throughout the day. How do I not react to the thoughts, even though I notice they are there?

Thanks for any advice!!","Night time is a hard time to be alone with your thoughts, but don’t let those thoughts define you as a person, your actions are showing that you’re trying to do your best for your mental health and you’re going to therapy. Everyone has intrusive thoughts, they always will be there and over time you will learn to live with them. I have been through many rough chapters of my life (21M). But the beautiful thing about life is it’s your story that you get to live and when you want to be done with one chapter you can choose to grow and start a new one. What I’m trying to say is you’re on the right path. Time heals many wounds (as cheesy as that sounds) but if you keep going, I’m sure you’ll continue to get better. Find the small things that make you happy in life and embrace the harder feelings and feel lucky that you are able to feel so many different things (it makes you human). 

Just keep doing your best :)"
I feel so alone,"This pain is so debilitating. I have a handful of friends but they have a lot going on and I feel like such a baggage whenever I try to reach out. They don't make me feel that way, they try so hard to understand and be there for me, but I need so much. I need and feel so, so, so much. I don't think any one of my friends can quite understand how much I'm suffering, and I don't want them to. I hate being pathetic, I hate holding people back.

I can't stop comparing myself to everyone. ,"The few people I know are doing so much better than me. The combination of that plus everything on the Internet, making me feel really bad about myself. Insignificant, hopeless, lazy, helpless. 

 I know it's my fault for not taking things seriously 10-15 years ago but idk how to do better at this point.  Any idea i come up with to either get another degree or advance my career seems like a huge mountain to climb that I don't actually want to do. I can't figure out something to go after. I tried to get my masters online so I can get a CPA, but lasted a semester and a half. 

I was always fine with having a modest full time job. I think this is why I became addicted to pot. If I stopped, then I have no more excuse to just be mediocre. But then after my daughter turned one, all these feelings came to light and it's been a spiral out of control for 3 years because I still don't act on anything. I know, it's my own fault. 

Seeing my sister yesterday, who's a doctor married to a doctor, was so triggering. Hearing about their fourth trip to Disney coming up next week and all the stuff her kids are getting for Christmas. Meanwhile we most likely are not affording vacation this year and have about 3 gifts for our daughter. 

I don't want to see anybody at this point. It's a lose/lose. Compare and despair or be alone. ",Hi friend. We are all running our own race. Comparing yourself to others isn’t the way forward. You are not as bad off as you think. Heck you’re doing way better than me. Love you.
Wanna end it,"These past year has just been too much, I had been thru a lot, and was working through things to get better. I met someone online and got manipulated multiple times, and it’s just put me in this place where it’s impossible to get out, I’ve tried doing everything, I’ve tried working on myself, I’ve tried contacting this person to work through the manipulations I’ve been put through but nothing works. My mental health just keeps going downwards and idk what to do anymore, my head just keeps buzzing from things that are unresolved and the place I’m in just keeps getting darker and darker. I really want to put myself out of my misery and pain.",Hi friend. If someone is manipulating you I recommend not contacting them. Not even to work things out. I’m not sure exactly what’s going on with your situation but I would avoid contacting this person. You can’t work on yourself and heal if you’re actively being messed with. Love you.

And if your thoughts are all cloudy and negative, there r reasons to continue and fight what tells u to leave it all behind. 
The reason we can have these conversations and these thoughts differences us from other animals. And besides that when ur mum tells u she loves u she means it.

Your drive to tell me not to kill myself comes out of your innate biological ability called empathy that life developed out of necessity to survive. It has no meaning whether I tell a person to not kill themselves or I tell them to kill themselves, It is simply one or the other and how you perceive them with your emotions is simply how you have been programmed from birth to optimally survive and reproduce as any other lifeform. It's all meaningless. I do not want to live because living is suffering and I do not want to suffer therefore I will leave. I do not care for others or what they feel because objectively even their emotions are just meaningless, purposeless emotions at the end of the day that don't hold any value or meaning."

So based on your replies here, I have to tell you it struck me that you are insanely brilliant. no, this is not me saying this to convince you of a different outcome it’s just objectively the truth. 

 I can relate to you on the way you intellectualize when deeply depressed, instead of leading with only pure emotion. I know that I find it way easier to think with my head than to think with my heart, because if I do.. well I have no idea what will come up from inside of me… or, rather- *I do know* subconsciously what will come up, but do not feel prepared to go down the rabbit hole. I don’t even bother with the emotional sides much anymore but I’m trying to, and questioning why that is, and reflecting if I could go back and pin point where that mental switch was made. What was going on then for me in my life, what were my feelings etc. 

 See, there is usually (but not always, sometimes it’s hereditary/genetic chemical) a reason for a person to have depression. What stops us from lessening the depression is when we shut down and choose not to be curious about the “why”. Depression is a symptom of ______ feeling/trauma/loss/abuse etc. We must use both the brain AND the heart. Identify it. Deconstruct it. Write about it. Research it. Even if we are just a clump of cells, we are all going to die in the end anyway, why not try while you’re here. You never know, by this time next year you could be writing a comment to someone on here telling them to keep going and sharing what you know got you through it.

Put in the effort for yourself. You are deserving of a great and inspirational life. Do it for the child version of you."

yeah well, that's just empathy and it means nothing so I don't care.  and the only thing I lose by not caring is society's approval. To answer your question It does come down to existence itself though, but yeah my life has been a complete utter shitfest aswell that's not worth living. People usually have something that keeps them stuck down here, family they care about, friends, hope of a better future, a pet, a hobby, something or someone they love very much. I don't have that. I don't have anything that I love very much or that I put above myself, which is selfish I know, but it is just the truth. I have nothing to look forward to that is worth the suffering that I have to endure on a day-to-day basis. It's a lot of suffering for very little good. I have even looked for God because even if I know the most probable truth of this world, It doesn't seem even an ounce real that all this, all of this suffering that we have to endure in this infinitely complex universe is just for absolutely fucking nothing. No, there HAS to be something to live for. It can't be as simple that the universe just WAS out of nothing or apparently 2 atoms and a fart and here we are out of pure chance, order out of complete chaos. What? I know that I am just programmed to think this way, but still. I haven't been able to shake that thought fully, but yet I haven't found anything that would prove my hopes either. It feels like a big fat ugly middle finger that the universe has thrown at me. ""Fuck you, exist and suffer for absolutely nothing you worthless carbon-based bags of absolute shit"". nah no thanks i'll take my leave. ✌️"
When it rains It pours,"So about 6 months ago me and my fiancé split up, she had our son and won’t let me see him. I lost my job shortly after we broke up and couldn’t find another one for 2 months. Lost the house I was paying for and my landlord sued me for 4k worth of damages consisting of “Damage to property, property clean up, and back pay in rent” Only seen my son once😕 And my car finally broke down yesterday. Feel like giving up on life. Im trying my absolute hardest right now, I have a job again and finally got my saving back up but everything is crumbling.","Listen to me, you might feel like you’re at rock bottom, like everything you’ve worked for is slipping through your fingers. But here’s the thing about rock bottom: it’s a solid foundation. It’s where the people who rise the highest are built. You can either stay down and let life crush you, or you can use this moment—the raw, painful truth of it—to rebuild something unstoppable.

You’ve survived everything life has thrown at you up until now, and don’t you dare forget that. Those scars you carry? They’re proof that you’ve been through the fire and came out alive. Falling apart isn’t the end; it’s the beginning of something new. It’s a chance to drop the weight of what’s not working and build yourself back stronger, smarter, and more determined.

You are not your mistakes. You are not your failures. You are every ounce of grit, resilience, and fire that’s still alive inside you. Life is daring you to prove it wrong, to stand up and say, “This is not where my story ends.”

You’ve got this. One step, one decision, one moment at a time. Don’t look at the whole mountain; just focus on the next step. That’s how legends are made—by refusing to stay down when the world expects them to. And you? You’re going to rise like no one ever saw coming. Let today be the start."
just another holiday sadpost,"I'm not usually the biggest fan of discussing my feelings with others, but therapists in the past have suggested journaling as a way to work through my feelings- I'm hoping you all don't mind me doing so here.

  
I'm having a really rough night tonight, for a couple of different reasons.

Some background- I'm a 33 year old man who has depression and an anxiety disorder, I take daily medication for both, which does help.

My family came by today for Thanksgiving which was great-  we watched some movies and played a board game-- good times!  
  
My mom also brought a box of old school stuff that she kept- my highschool diploma, a bunch of newspaper clippings that I was in, old report cards and awards. When I went through this stuff, I just started bawling my eyes out. Seeing all these old awards and accomplishments just made me feel like I'm such a huge failure now--made me feel like I used to be great but that I'm broken and worthless now.

I'm mad at myself for feeling this way- I feel so stupid. I shouldn't need external validation from others to appreciate myself. It's not like your boss is going to give you a 1st place ribbon like elementary school- lol. I should love myself and have self-esteem based on who I am as a person, I shouldn't need someone else to tell me my worth- and I'm so frustrated at myself for this. Why can't I see my own value and take pride in that anymore?

  
My mom's a great person, and gave me hugs and helped talk me through my feelings of failure tonight, but when she left to go home I just collapsed on the floor sobbing again. I guess I didn't realize how much I missed them until I saw them tonight. My mom has pets and I'm very allergic-- even when I take two different allergy meds I can only be around the house for about an hour before it becomes unbearable for me-- so I really don't get to go visit her at all- I haven't seen them since my birthday in Sept. I've had this conversation with her and given her a key to my house-- tried to do all I can to make sure they know they're welcome here anytime and that I'd love to see them, but it's really only holidays that she takes me up on that. Getting rid of the pets isn't a possible solution-- my mom deserves to have companionship and its my fault that I'm allergic, not hers.

I also feel stupid at myself for throwing a temper tantrum tonight like a fucking toddler. I went to turn on the sink to wash dishes after pulling myself together a bit, but the knob for the sink shattered in my hands. I lashed out destructively and hit my fridge-- breaking a fridge magnet that a friend bought for me. This just made me feel like a huge piece of shit. I'm a 30 year old man who can't process his own damn emotions well enough to not break something. It makes me feel like my father, when he would come home from deployment and hit me because he couldn't work through his feelings either.

I know I'm going to process these emotions and end up okay, but man does it suck tonight. Thanks for listening to me vent.",I felt the not being able to process your emotions part. Thank you for the kind words on my post. I felt like I had to come read yours. I don’t really have anything to say other than I read it and I understand completely. I hope you get better man.

I want to jump from the window and end this pain ,My cousin is sleeping in the other room And I'm alone in this room so I'm thinking about doing it now,"I’m only 23, and I already feel like I don’t have the capacity to keep going just because others do. I shouldn’t have to continue if I don’t want to—it’s my choice."
I want to jump from the window and end this pain ,My cousin is sleeping in the other room And I'm alone in this room so I'm thinking about doing it now,"I know small mistakes are okay, but the mistake I made cost me my studies, my career, and my future. I didn’t explain everything, so you can’t fully understand the consequences."
I want to jump from the window and end this pain ,My cousin is sleeping in the other room And I'm alone in this room so I'm thinking about doing it now,I don’t think it’s enough to keep going for others. I’ve spent my life trying to do the right thing for others and it quite literally feels like I said. Spent. My. Life. I have no more individual currency for the world and it’s all because Ive been giving it to other people.
I want to jump from the window and end this pain ,My cousin is sleeping in the other room And I'm alone in this room so I'm thinking about doing it now,"Yes, right, i don't have the context. But yk there are other possibilities for your studies and career"
I want to jump from the window and end this pain ,My cousin is sleeping in the other room And I'm alone in this room so I'm thinking about doing it now,I understand how exhausting it can feel to keep giving so much of yourself to others without leaving anything for yourself. It’s okay to feel drained after living this way for so long. You deserve to reclaim some of that energy for yourself and focus on what truly matters to you. Your life and well-being are just as important as anyone else’s.
I want to jump from the window and end this pain ,My cousin is sleeping in the other room And I'm alone in this room so I'm thinking about doing it now,"As I told you, it’s not as easy as you make it sound. This was my last chance, and now I can’t even go to that country again. Currently, I’m visiting my cousin in another country, and I’ve decided to stay here since I’m far from my original country, where no one knows me except my cousin."
I want to jump from the window and end this pain ,My cousin is sleeping in the other room And I'm alone in this room so I'm thinking about doing it now,"Im sorry. But still im persuaded that there are other options available for you. You have a future, you have it fr. Don't give up now. Please."
I want to jump from the window and end this pain ,My cousin is sleeping in the other room And I'm alone in this room so I'm thinking about doing it now,"As I told you, the thing I wanted is lost, and I can’t even bear to stay another day doing nothing. I just want to end everything, even all the memories why i would keep suffering"
i can hardly do this anymore,"i need help somehow. i got put in this intensive therapy program due to sh, which means i'm missing 3 days of school a week. and the teachers are exempting me from a lot of stuff but i just... can't. do anything. i can't bring myself to make up anything. i'm not even going to school the 2 days i'm meant to. i CAN'T. do this. they upped the dosage on my antidepressants which can apparently make you feel worse for a bit and idk if it's that or i'm just doing really poorly but i've been feeling so miserable. i don't know who to talk to. i'm not going to therapy for another 3 days and i don't even feel like i can make it. i just, need help. i feel so stupid making a reddit post about this","From what I’ve heard from other people, depression makes it really hard to do anything in general. Like even cleaning yourself and eating.

I never experienced that kind of stuff because I was always kinda high-functioning even while dealing with that, but I know that’s something alot of people struggle with so don’t feel bad about it.

Just do the best you can in taking care of yourself and doing what you need to do. There are no “small” victories, just victories."
"Friend died, missed funeral..life is a piece of shit. I hate myself and wish sooo bad I can kill myself. But I am pussy so yea there's that ","Best friend (in hs) died a month ago. I'm not too well versed  in these things (in how the whole death and funeral options take place), but the funeral was held 2 weeks ago. I didn't know


 & I had no clue. No one told me. My brother ""thought"" he texted me, which he didnt (he smokes alot of weed & drinks reguarly). And its like damn...when I heard the news I broke down crying (of him passing). I couldn't even contribute to his arbitrary in time (because im not to well versed in how these things go like i thought it was like a 2 month waiting period or some shit). I'm such a shit person. 



Like fuuuuckkkk!!!!! Why does this shit have to happen. I want to kill myself. Just fucking end it, I'm a demon. A sick bitch. A terrible friend no one loves me family is fake and secretly wants me to die....I want to grow old alone in a forest so I can never ever suffer the turmoil of heartbreak. Typing this shit alone makes me wanna drive a knife through my fucking skull 


Tldr: missed funeral, I am shit","You’re not a piece of crap for that. You made a mistake. You can still find his resting place and pay your respects. Maybe even write a letter to his family and apologize for missing the funeral, and tell them he mattered to you.

You made a mistake and that’s ok. Try to forgive yourself if you can. I’m also sorry for your loss. 🫂"
I need help,"Every single day of my life I just try to find something to do to not feel how I actually feel inside. I don't ever really feel happiness. I just try to make my self feel happy even when I know I'm not, to try to not feel what I really feel every second of my life. I feel numb to everything but pain it seems. I don't know how to achieve happiness in reality without some type of distraction from what I'm really feeling. It feels like I'm just constantly burning and constantly trying to find something to cool myself down until I feel like I'm burning away again. Every single day it's the same cycle. I don't understand I need help. I don't tell anyone about these feelings because I feel that I'll come off as a weak man and a piece of shit. How can I ever be happy again. I need to know. I cant attach myself to a girl because I just don't really feel anything and eventually I'll just give up on that because I'm so tired of faking my attachment even thought I want it so bad. How can I ever actually feel love and happiness again if I'm just stuck here. I need help please. Nobody knows how deep in depression I am besides myself and I don't want anybody to know but if I ever want to get better I need someone to help me. I'm stuck
","well I wanna help you. but how? I don't know.
maybe I can talk with you and understand your pain of this such kinda depression"

I am stuck, 3 years ago during the pandemic I underwent two surgeries and since that moment I have been living in a loop, not because of the memories but because my mind had fixed those feelings of fear, anxiety and depression which reinforced my feeling of defeat and brokenness. A year ago I surrendered to reality and started taking Cipralex after I was diagnosed with severe depression, the medication did not take effect until after three weeks and its effect lasted for a short period before it disappeared, I changed my doctor and the new doctor told me that Cipralex was not the best option for my condition and I started taking davlex but this unlike the first one did not work at all and not for a short period, I do not feel it except when I stop taking it then I feel a headache and brain fog. My studies since then have been disastrous, there is a subject I have repeated 7 times, but I have failed 4 semesters and have only passed 2 subjects during these years, at least I know that I am not stupid as I finished my first academic year at university with an excellent grade, but now I am close to being expelled, despite the huge financial and life losses I cannot make any effort as if I am running a marathon with broken feet. Everything I have tried to do has failed in the face of this loop and during the current sensitive period it does not seem that I am able to change and control things, as my life is like a repetition of everything that used to happen from bad and long sleep and a miserable psychological state, postponement of exams and bad studying followed by lack of concentration, there is a defect in my mind and I do not have the slightest idea on how to overcome it.
I am stuck between dreams, ambitions like all humans, and my mind and body that refuse to make any effort or change.",A little bit disappointing to see no response…
It takes everything I have just to be “ok”,"I just need to know that I’m not alone in this aspect of dealing with depression. I believe I do quite a few things to give myself an outlet for this thing. I live an active lifestyle, I’m a creative, I have a great support system, etc., etc..

But, despite all of these things.. all that I have to be grateful and appreciative of, I’m always stuck with this perpetual unhappiness.. sadness. I feel helpless and hopeless. I have to wear a mask with everyone because I don’t want them to worry, but I just don’t have the energy to keep up this facade anymore.

It takes everything I have to give just to keep myself from spiraling downward everyday. It feels like torture, and it’s been this way for as long as I can remember.","You’re not alone. I put all my energy into just trying to seem normal/ friendly at work, then go home and rot the rest of my time. Add anything extra on top of work/ cooking/ cleaning and I start to spiral. 

Wish I could say it gets better but it hasn’t yet for me. But I keep going because I know the only way it 100% can’t get any better is if I’m dead. That’s my outlook, at least."

We can hope, try this thing and try that thing, but more or less we’re right back in this same cycle. Something in me is just broken that I can’t fix I guess."

It’s been 4 years since then, and 3 of them are now married or engaged and one is having a kid. Now, their lives could still suck and they just hide it well, but from what I can see they seem to have found some kind of happiness. And if they can do it, why can’t we?"

i can't live like this anymore,I tried to end it 4 times this week. I was so close to stabbing myself in the throat. I don't wanna live.Not a lot of people like me at school since I'm kinda weird but I try to make up for it. I don't even think I have a purpose life since I always overreact to little things. I'm not even smart. I'm ugly and mostly everyone in school looks better than me. I look in the mirror or look at a picture at myself and realized how I will never be attractive. I keep having feelings and thoughts about being a girl and it just makes everything worse. I never wanted to be a girl yet I have those feelings and urges of becoming one. It's like no matter how hard I try to remove those thoughts it's always there. I barely slept last night and only got 3 or 4 hours of sleep. When I try to help or I have to do something I always messed it up. There's no point of living.,Have you ever thought about transitioning?

Hating myself so much right now,"Every Thanksgiving and Christmas is the same. I still live with my mother and sometimes I’ll have family come over to visit.

Am I depressed or just sad?,"Hi,
So I don't know if I am suffering from  depression or it's just being sad.
I had abusive childhood with my parents.
And it got me trauma. I feel lack of empty, dullness in life like there is nothing in life just an empty shell.
I feel so low-esteem. I can't express my feelings to others. I don't like social gathering. I like and spend my most of the time in home. Other people think me as friend and etc but I don't feel that attachment with them. They may think me as thier friend but I can't.

What problem do I have? Am I depressed or what? Do I need medical help?","I feel similar feelings myself, and I'm coming to learn how impactful an abusive or traumatic childhood really can be. Have you ever checked out any of the troubled upbringing subreddits? Reading the experiences of others on subs like EmotionalNeglect and cptsd have really helped me to understand and explain how I'm feeling myself. I've been reading some of the recommended books from these places that help to explain how an abusive childhood can really leave you struggling with attachment issues and other difficult feelings as an adult."

And as I am rn I can self harm myself if I don't restrain myself.
I got asked what I’m thankful for today.,"There I was just trying to eat dinner tonight when i was asked what I was thankful for... I lied. I’m not happy about lying but I had to. The only thing I could think to say was that I was thankful for waking up. I’m not. I haven’t been. 



I dread the daily existence that is my life. I wake up each morning with an empty “furnace”. This same furnace used to hold the flame of excitement and desire for life and future. I’m trapped in my life. Too weak to take myself out of it but not strong enough to make those improvements.   


I don’t even know who I am anymore. 

I’m not useful or desirable for who I am, only what I can do. 

I’ve only been measured in one of two ways in my life:

1.  How I’m doing compared to my peers.  
2. How much have I helped or served others today.

  
I‘ve just now started living in my 30s and HEY, WOULDNT YOU KNOW IT?! It’s not “getting better”",I can’t shake the feeling my life is a slow collapse. An ever present and relentless caving in of the thinly veiled walls I let others build for me.

But I’m still angry with myself and my life. I know I did this to myself, but are we truly expected to be alone? If we’re a social species and I’ve given so much socially to others…when do I receive that back? 

Am I already receiving this from others?
 If I am; is it even in the form of help I NEED or is it simply what they feel like giving me?

Is this something I have to figure out myself?"
I should walk but no motivation,"Hi,

I have depression and now I am also on meds. I know meds is just a tool to help me and it wont be a magic pill. So I know I need to walk or just a light running, but I prefer walk as I dont have any energy. I have no motivation but I also know that there will never be motivation to walk, I just need to get up and go outside. I live in a small town and when I go outside I just see cars, it seems that everybody is using cars. Exercise would be benefical for my depression but It is just not easy to go out and walk. I am wondering how others can walk every day. I have this depression and I just want not to have it, I know this is what everybody wants. I have also therapy and doing CBT, plus I read a lot about it. It is just so difficult. Do you do exercise? Walk or something else? At the moment my depression is so severe that I can not work. When I do something I get very tired and need to sit down and wait. When I go out for a walk I can feel its benefits but I can not imagine myself to have that discipline to go out every single day.","I can only speak what worked for me. I had to cold shower myself to get me to exercise. It would reduce my anxiety and gave me a charge to do other daunting tasks.

I would also make a huge focus on not avoiding it because then the anxiety would grow stronger for avoiding it. 

Cold showers seems to reduce anxiety and increase my will to do more hard things."

A few years ago, I had some medical issues that left me unable to take many steps and I was left housebound.

What helped me to get started was purchasing a cheap fitness watch that could record steps. For a while I could only walk from room to room in my home so I would start with small goals like 500 steps per day. I gradually built up to 1000 steps and then made the swap to walking outside.

At first, I was limited to only walking up and down my road but over several weeks, I started to build up to going around one block and so on, and so on...

I had many bad days where I couldn't match my previous steps but I just eased back and tried again the next day or the next day....

Fast forward to the present. I now run approximately 100 miles per month and it's changed my whole outlook on life.

Start real small if you feel you can. Even 100 steps per day counts as a start on the journey. Can't leave the house due to anxiety? Walk around the house instead and take a seat if it gets to be too much. Take a breather and do another 100 steps of you can. If not, that's ok too.

Never be too hard on yourself if it doesn't come together immediately and allow yourself room for failure days. If you fail, that's ok. Try again the next day and I promise you'll start to see benefits.

Wishing you the best of luck and sending motivation you way."

I feel like I am kind of lazy to do any walk outside and I just feel terrible that I am the only person who is walking outside. I also know that I can not know it for sure as anybody can be outside and walking. 

And do you go out every single day? Are you walking/running alone? 

Before I was living in a busy area where people ran a lot but now I am in a suburb where people are just staying home. Literaly I see no people walking/running on the streets and it makes my walking so lonely.

I am wondering that dont people need to walk???? Everybody is using cars. When I walk for 20 minutes I see at least 20 cars or more but no walking person."

When I go out I listen to some podcast or music. On day one I go out but on day 2 I already break the cycle. And I dont go out on day 3,4,5…. .

The holidays make me sad ,"I used to enjoy the holidays, but since my grandpa passed a way back in 2011, things have not been the same. I remember spending thanksgiving cooking and making him a plate to bring to him at his house. He wasn’t a very social person and preferred to stay home. I didn’t mind because I was able to see him regardless for a bit. This was before he got sick. He suffered a stroke and then a heart attack. It broke my heart knowing my grandpa was suffering. He passed away 2 weeks after Christmas. We would do the same thing for Christmas. Make a plate and bring it over to him to enjoy. I just miss him so much! I know he will be proud of me and would have wanted to meet my son. I think of him every single day and it hurts and feels like it happened just yesterday. 

Now during the holidays, I feel emptiness and sadness. I try to keep up appearances for my son so he doesn’t worry. I have jumped into cooking and baking and it’s helped a bit. I remember traditions my family used to take on and now that the family is severely divided, we don’t communicate with one another very often. It just makes me sad ","I'm so sorry, your kindness towards your grandpa was so nice to read.  I'm so sorry for your losing him.  For me, death takes a very long time to feel better.     My family is the same, so sad, but now I've noticed it's a pretty common thing to happen when kids grow up.    Seeing ""normal"" families just makes it worse.   Just know that your family is not that unusual, and many people are in your shoes."
For everyone trying to get over their ex read this. It hurts but it’ll help.,"Here’s the harsh truth: if your ex truly valued you the way you deserved, you wouldn’t be sitting here trying to move on. They weren’t capable of giving you the love and respect you needed, or they simply chose not to. Every second you spend dwelling on them is a second stolen from your future—a future with someone who will actually see your worth without needing to be reminded.

They’re not thinking about you the way you’re thinking about them right now. And you deserve better than to be someone’s afterthought. Every time you look back, you’re doing a disservice to the version of yourself that fought to survive the pain they caused. Let them be a lesson, not a destination.

Feeling numb/disconnected most of the time,"(sorry, a long one)

I never considered myself as someone suffering from depression (well, except for a couple months after a rough breakup a couple years ago, that probably fucked me up to a certain degree), from the outside you wouldn’t be able to tell.. But lately I realized that I feel quite indifferent most of the time, almost apathetic. There are periods of time when I can totally get excited about things (ADHD hyperfocus mainly), but it never lasts. Now it feels like those are all mere distractions.

I’ve been on a solo trip recently (travel being one of the few things that usually keep me excited, at least briefly), with little distractions, no people to talk to, tried to stay off my phonefor a bit, and suddenly I felt like there’s no point in existing. Like everything is meaningless..more on a personal than existential level... even visiting a new place felt sort of “shallow”, like another distraction. I’ve got a couple close friends who care about me, a person who I’m intimate with casually (and who’s also a good friend, but I feel like I can’t ever fully open up/allow feelings due to avoidant attachment/some abandonment trauma..which makes me feel sad, b/c what’s the point in life really, when you can’t allow deep emotional connections with others?), for which I should be grateful, but at this point I thought that if I just stopped existing, it wouldn’t even matter..and this feeling kind of persists since then, which scares me (although no active suicidal thoughts).

I’m more or less high-functioning as of being able to keep a job (but without the “structure”/responsibility my work provides, I would probably be lost..it kind of grounds me), socializing now and then - but more than 1-2x a week feels so exhausting -but after work or on weekends, when I don’t meet up with people (which feels like just another distraction sometimes, brief dopamine hits, sometimes interpersonal connection, but mostly I still feel kind of emotionally detached). Most of the time this feels almost peaceful, but sometimes I really miss emotional intensity, and feel like I experience everything through a filter, or a thick fog, like being disconnected from reality and running on autopilot 80% of the time..

Anyone can relate? Is this what depression feels like? Guess I just wanted to articulate those feelings (can't really talk to any friends about death thoughts as I don't want to freak anyone out..)",yes i relate 100% it sucks..

I’ve been on a solo trip recently (travel being one of the few things that usually keep me excited, at least briefly), with little distractions, no people to talk to, tried to stay off my phonefor a bit, and suddenly I felt like there’s no point in existing. Like everything is meaningless..more on a personal than existential level... even visiting a new place felt sort of “shallow”, like another distraction. I’ve got a couple close friends who care about me, a person who I’m intimate with casually (and who’s also a good friend, but I feel like I can’t ever fully open up/allow feelings due to avoidant attachment/some abandonment trauma..which makes me feel sad, b/c what’s the point in life really, when you can’t allow deep emotional connections with others?), for which I should be grateful, but at this point I thought that if I just stopped existing, it wouldn’t even matter..and this feeling kind of persists since then, which scares me (although no active suicidal thoughts).

I’m more or less high-functioning as of being able to keep a job (but without the “structure”/responsibility my work provides, I would probably be lost..it kind of grounds me), socializing now and then - but more than 1-2x a week feels so exhausting -but after work or on weekends, when I don’t meet up with people (which feels like just another distraction sometimes, brief dopamine hits, sometimes interpersonal connection, but mostly I still feel kind of emotionally detached). Most of the time this feels almost peaceful, but sometimes I really miss emotional intensity, and feel like I experience everything through a filter, or a thick fog, like being disconnected from reality and running on autopilot 80% of the time..

Anyone can relate? Is this what depression feels like? Guess I just wanted to articulate those feelings (can't really talk to any friends about death thoughts as I don't want to freak anyone out..)","I feel this. The only time I feel normal is when some project or task is taking up all my attention, which rarely happens nowadays. The rest of the time I’m in a fog, trying to act like I’m not completely disinterested in what’s going on."
truly how do i get rid of suicidal thoughts ,my mom is going to die. she is the only person i have left in my life. i honestly want to die with her,"Stability. Do whatever it takes to remain stable in mind and body. Christianity helps tremendously, but any sort of routine practice will help.
It's also important to reach out to anyone you can. Community is like the ultimate life preserver in times like these

I'd say more but I myself am not ok. Know you are loved, and therefore are not done with this world yet"

I think I’ve been living in a bubble all my life thinking I am better than most people, and they don’t know my story. Always dismissing others thinking they’re stupid! 

Have been a loner all my life, an absolute hermit- thinking that I’m far more superior because I don’t enjoy doing the inane superficial things people around me are on about. So I was fine not having any friends. 

But in the recent years, the more I’ve been exposed to the world, I feel like damn, people know so many things, and I don’t know shit. I feel so dumb. I’m not updated about politics, there are so many people at my job who are so knowledgeable. More I read, the more I realise I am so far behind. 

Now I feel neither am I here nor there! 

I feel like a fool. I’m disappointed in myself. I feel unmotivated. What do I do?","Everyone is the main character of their own story.

hang on to this feeling and turn it into humility and a desire for self improvement. lose your ego, love and appreciate the good and talent in others. there *are* stupid people and geniune curiosity and passion are rare. ego holds people back. *i am becoming an invisible eyeball. i am nothing and i see all.*

easier said than done but i think you are on a virtuous path"

Really don’t know how much longer I will last.,"I am completely miserable at my job and don’t have many skills to consider a career change, nor could I afford one. I am in a ton of debt. I constantly feel like a burden towards my partner, our children because I feel like we are not living the best life we could be. I might lose my job in the new year and that’s a stress I don’t even want to think about 

The worst part is, I try. I try so hard to be a good person. I try so hard to be a good coworker. I try so hard to be a good parent. I try I try I try but people treat me like garbage at work. My partner gets mad at me for any tiny thing I do and is borderline mentally abusive. My hobbies don’t interest me anymore. I’m made to feel like a bad parent all the time. I think everyone in my immediate family would be better off without me and that my partner would be better off going to find someone else to raise our children with at this point as I am constantly taken for granted. 

Existence just feels like one awful repeating day over and over and I’m constantly made to feel like I don’t deserve happiness despite having most or all of the things anyone would consider a million times blessed over to have. 

It feels like I have the golden life that any person would describe as happiness or “making it” in life, but that it’s just one big monkey paw curse and fuck you 

I just have no idea what to do. ","You can only do the best that you can. It won’t be perfect and that’s ok. What matters is that you don’t give up on yourself or the people that matter to you. You’re very strong for making it this far in life, and you may yet have even more strength than you’re currently aware of. Don’t give up."
I want to commit suicide today ,I just want him to talk to me again :(,"And i want her to talk to me. We all miss someone. Mine left me 12 years ago and i miss her everyday. I somehow kept waking up though and getting through the days. Are they hard sometimes? Yes. Are there good days? Yes. 

The point is. I’m still here after 12 years. You’ll be here 12 years from now to. Will you still miss him? Maybe. But maybe not. Maybe you’ll find someone else. I didn’t. But you might. 

Ill be here tomorrow. And so will you."

I can't take it anymore,"I'm here to not even know, vent? talk? I'm tired... it seems like God gave me a very heavy battle that is too hard for me to carry, every day is a fight with myself. I've been crying constantly for 2 weeks because I feel alone, and this 26th I turned 16 and I can't take it anymore, seriously, I can't take it anymore, everything in my fucking life is destroyed, I can't spend a fucking minute without my mind invading me again with the same fucking problems I have, I can't stop crying every day. I'm trying to meet a girl, we share similar tastes, like music, food, etc. but everything went to hell because of my fucking way of answering messages, dry shit, and what else? My FUCKING shitty nationality, seriously, I can't open my fucking mouth and say something without someone reminding me that I'm Venezuelan and that I'm an immigrant, I can't say that I work in something because they tell me ""don't Venezuelans only work in rappi?"". What's going on? My fucking nationality screwed up everything I tried to build with that girl, now I feel like I'm forcing her to talk to me and she answers me dryly. Nobody asks me how I really feel, or even wants to talk to me seriously. Calisthenics and trying to think about Jesus is the only thing that calms me down a bit, but then that self-hatred comes back, I feel like shit, I always fail Jesus even though I know he forgives, and a lot more.



My birthday 2 days ago was shit, my father scolded me for not turning in a history notebook, when I clearly told him that it was lost, what else? He got mad at me, I told my mother while we were eating sushi at home, she said: ""What do you have with your father?"", I told her: ""I never considered him my father, he's only financially and he only gave his sperm to have me."" My father couldn't take it anymore and he smashed my keyboard against the floor and yelled at me, clearly he screwed me horribly... but it was even worse, we almost got into a fight, but I let it go, but then he started talking shit like he always does when he's angry, thinking he has all the fucking truth in life, I couldn't take it anymore and I yelled his fucking truths in front of my mother. But she pinned me against the wall hitting me, I think I passed out for a few seconds and he kept hitting me until he let me go, I kept crying... and the two of us were talking shit, I just went back to high school as if nothing had happened, but I couldn't take it anymore and I cried in the arms of a friend hugging him as hard as I could and I cried, thank God he gave me comfort.



And today comes, I see no reason to live, I failed at everything I wanted, I think I am a very heavy family burden, I have failed God countless times, and I no longer see a reason, if you do not see an update it is possibly because I already did it, God bless you.","You need to report this to the police. That is considered abuse if they physically hit you like that. You need to file a restraining order against your parents asap and move in with a trusting adult (maybe a mentor or someone that  must be decent in your family).

Prayers with everything man. I hope love will come around to you asap❤️"

my mom don't believe me,"Hi everyone. A couple days ago I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I am having a really rough time right now, a lot has to do with school (but it's not the main reason). 
I have a pretty good life, and nothing I have to complain: but i know that something is wrong in me because I still feel helpless (even tough I have no reason to think that). 

So the main problem here is that my doctor gave me antidepressants. My mom knows about it because she asked how my appointment went. I told her about the pills and she said ''but you're not depressed''. I'm not even sure I'm going to take them for the moment but she keeps sending me messages, and talking about it even though I keep telling her that I know what she thinks it and there's no point in keeping talking about it.

She keeps telling me that ''at your age (I'm in my early 20s') i was feeling the same and I didnt complain'' ''everyone is having a rough time its called life'' ''you dont have anything bad going on in your life, you're just privileged''. At this point I'm not even arguing with her because she won't listen to me, but she continues and continues on and on. She finished the conversation by ''Only people with a lot of time on their hands can be selfish like that'' 

I don't even understand what she means because I do not complain, she was the one initiating the conversation. I do not ask for pity or anything from her really, I didn't say anything. I do not blame her, I do not blame anything it's just the way it is, I do not understand why she is so mad at me for looking for help ? Again, I'm not even sure if I'm going to take the medication. 

Also there's 2 diagnosed bipolar in my family (1 from each side), and I think my mother has an undiagnosed emotional unbalance (im sorry english isnt my first language, i dont know how to call this) so like yeah maybe its normal for her to feel like this but obviously that's not how ''''normal''''' people live their life. 


I will be grateful if someone could have me any advice on how to explain to her that I am not creating problems for attention or anything: i'm feeling like this since I was 12 years old and every year, it's getting worse and worse. If I am seeking help now, it's because it became a real problem in my day to day life and I really don't know how to navigate this without any professional help....? So why is she mad at me for trying to help myself? I really do not understand. 

Thank you for your time and for anyone that can help me understand the situation:) !","Hey there, i had the same issue with my mother too, i have depression since my mid teens maybe even before and i always tried to understand what's wrong with me.
My mother never believed that i have depression or anxiety even though i told her that i want to commit suicide etc.
She started to take things more seriously just after she found my brother's suicide note and took him to therapy.
So I'm with you, i know it's hard for you to not get any help from your parents but sometimes that's life..
I do still believe that you are strong enough to deal with this stuff and i really proud of you to write it down on reddit, i know it took me a while, if you need any help/advice you can reach me :)"
I really hate myself,"I just look in the mirror and start talking how useless i am. if i could, i would beat the crap out of myself. i always mess things up that i cant even stand it anymore. Its so bad i might actually hurt myself or even relapse into self-harm because of how much i hate myself. its been so long seen ive felt this angry i feel like screaming punching walls and just start beating myself up bro (just venting rn)","same, i feel you.

all i do is break stuff, get bad grades, make a fool of myself

Now, nothing works - not pills, booze, smoking.  I'm just a long suffering mess; no relief.

How they can turn my thought process from suicidal to wanting to go back to playing a simple game ","Antidepressants are drugs. If you get off them you start to sober up which is definitely not pleasant. 

However it’s not like heroin which will act instantly, they sort of change how your brain functions in a slower way. Missing one typically doesn’t/ shouldn’t have this effect. I’m more enclined towards saying this is a placebo effect.

The good part is that they also happen to be a treatment, they’re happy pills for a bit until your brain learns to function on its own, which it will. When that happens your psychiatrist will slowly take you off them, as to not cold turkey you (which is really bad never do that). And then you will feel better without them than with them.

So don’t worry about all of that for now, follow your treatment, work on bettering yourself as best as you can, and don’t torture yourself over missing a day, your body can handle it.

I hope it gets better"

I’ve tapered off, and in a quest to lessen what I was taking, they’d just give me a new one to try. I did TMS this summer & I was floored at the difference. It’s a bit of a commitment, you hv to go every day 36 days for a 15 min appt. I’m repeating it in the spring, sometimes it takes more. But it’s approved by the FDA, usually covered by insurance & literally requires your brain. It helped me immensely. Do a lil research & check out the TMS groups here, on Reddit. Good luck!"

How they can turn my thought process from suicidal to wanting to go back to playing a simple game ","i dont think reliance on tools is a bad thing, because ultimately this is what this is, a tool for regulating unnecessarily rapid fluctuations in our mood. it doesn’t get rid of them, i am still able to feel extreme sadness after years on fluoxitine; it’s just that now that’s not my normal response to mild inconveniences anymore. the sadness is still there, it’s just much more true to the weight of the situation rather than going off wild right from the start. the anxiety is still there, just now much more deliberate according to the needs of life. 

sorry idk this is just how i view things. i was scared too that these pills would take away some aspect of myself that i’d never be able to get back. they don’t insofar as a needle valve adjusts flow out of a bucket. it regulates it much easily than just pouring the whole thing out. i might be misunderstanding completely but again this is just the way i see it. 

tbh the fact that they allow me to effectively treat them like nothing, is the most profoundly beautiful aspect of how they work. high return with little cost is exactly the intent of anything i’d ever develop if i’d ever wish to truly help someone. weird comparison but it’s like IT. the more effective it is the less you have to see them. 

it’s not like truly addictive substances where the cost to achieve the same result rises with every hit.  the intent is to be slower and more controlled, not to be a rush into immediate highs or lows. 

idk sorry i’ll stop rambling now it’s just that being myself and staying is also really important to me. i was scared that meds would alter that. from my understanding they don’t actually take anything away inasmuch as they are simply giving you more control

good luck my friend it’s really fucking tough out there"
Something I wrote after I forgot my pills for the first time. ,"I hadn’t realized how reliant I’d become on the little green pills that stay in my kitchen

I treated the process of consuming them as if it were nothing 

Popping them in my mouth and dry swallowing without a care, and then retreating back to my bedroom for another round of video games 

It was only until I forgot them that I truly understood the impact they were having on my emotional regulation and overall health

The night I forgot to take the pills, I woke up the next morning with a heavy weight on my back and tears just beneath the surface ready to roll down my cheek at even the slightest misfortune

How they can turn my thought process from suicidal to wanting to go back to playing a simple game ","Well, at least they work for you. It may be counted as something good.

I knew a person who just suffered from severe side effects but kept taking them because their therapist insisted. I just got +20 pounds of weight and nothing else.

If they don't let you hit the very bottom of the abyss it's give a tiny sparkle of light at the end of the tunnel."

should I get checked for depression? ,"hi, this is really weird for me to talk about so I’m going to try my best to put this in simple words. I have not entertained the idea of being depressed until the past few days (I’m not sure why) 

Some context: I’m f(19). It’s been very hard for me for the past few years in a lot of areas of my life. I chalked it up to fucked dopamine levels and needing to quit social media etc etc 
I have struggled massively with insecurity about my body and the way I looked, to the point where I stopped going out and still dread going out. I would tell all my friends that I’m busy and I have something on that day in the hopes of being able to go out and be happy when I’m finally “beautiful” enough. This insecurity has consumed every aspect of my life, affecting my education (went from A student to failing eveyrthing), can’t study because I feel so uncomfortable in my body and turned to food and social media as a source of comfort which made things worse as they made me feel shittier. this started when I was around 12 but really started affected me when I was around 14. 

I remember finding it very hard to listen in class and school felt like absolute hell for me. I would wake up extremely anxious because I had to go out for sch and could not hide in my room all day. in class, I would feel extremely anxious I suppose for long periods of time and would doodle and do anything but concentrate to distract myself. Which clearly affected my grades 

Right now, I find it very hard to do stuff. I don’t understand if it’s cuz I’m lazy and don’t realise it or if there is actually something I need to be concerned about. it’s very hard for me to shower fully as disgusting as it sounds. Seems so tedious. It’s hard for me to do chores and makes me irritable which often results in me snapping at my family members for no reason. I hate interacting with people and even my friends even tho I appreciate them a lot. my insecurities has made any form of dating extremely hard for me so I have never engaged in that. I feel very hopeless about life and my future. I have dreams and ambitions but I don’t know to move on from here. I’ve been feeling this way for years and chalked it up to a lack of discipline. I’m sure there are more scenarios I can’t talk about but anything that requires energy or effort no matter how big or small seems extremely daunting. I can’t live like this. 

I’m not asking anyone if I have depression of some sort, I’m asking if people think it’s worth spending a few hundred bucks at a psychologist or if I am truly just a lazy fuck HAHA. (I’m asian so I’d have to spend money from a part time job myself and have no family support in this situation) ","Oh, honey you sound just like me. I started hating my body at 10, struggled with grades and paying attention in school, and worry I'm lazy even though I wish I had the energy and motivation to just do the things. 

I'm 32 and have finally found a good therapist I speak to weekly. She says these things are all common amongst high functioning mentally ill people. You are not lazy at all. I'm not saying you have depression, but you are exhibiting a lot of the symptoms of someone who might be depressed.

I hate to be one of those ""mmm...society"" people, but we are trapped in hell scapes that are constantly telling us what we need to look like and what we need to do to be valuable. It's all such bullshit honestly, and no wonder we feel lazy, ugly, and miserable. It's nothing wrong with you, and I'm so sorry you feel like you don't have support amongst your family."

Almost as if my emotions and behaviour would be validated if something bad happen to me. this is not what a healthy person thinks right? like this is not normal? 
I just want to be normal. I want to be able to do decent in school, I want to be able to put in minimal effort and not completely neglect my education and health. like i desperately want to be healthy and productive and discipline but it seems so daunting and I have 0 energy no matter how much I rest or how well I eat. like what do I even do rn 
Do I see a therapist or a psychologist or a psychiatrist? I’ve seen a psychiatrist before but he was very unwelcoming and said there is nothing wrong with me because I was hesitant and ashamed to open up about my body insecurity issues and how much it was affecting me. My parents were also mad at me cuz they spent $500 on it. I genuinely don’t know wtf to do anymore. I don’t wanna feel like a failure for the rest of my life"

It's not good to think like that, but it doesn't mean you're a bad person. Whoever you saw before was a bad doctor. Are you able to request a female doctor next time? I think you may benefit from starting with a psychologist. They're someone you would do talk therapy with. I personally talk to a therapist once a week. They would be able to help you figure out if you could benefit from medication too. 

You're not a failure, your brain is just working against you."

I don't want to hate my mother ,"I am not sure if this is the right sub. But I just want to get this off my chest. 

I love my mother. She has done lots of things for me. So I have always felt a sense of responsibility to protect her from the things she can't. Yes, I am the parentified oldest daughter. The in house therapist, dispute resolution personnel. Honestly, it doesn't hurt my feelings anymore. It's like an old accountant's job. 

But every once in a while, I make the foolish mistake of going to my mother with my problems. You know, a simple ~hey ma! My lorazepam dose got doubled~ etc. As a fellow mentally broken person, and the person whom you gave birth to, also the person who actively takes criticism from everyone to protect you - you'd think she would show a little more sympathy than changing the subject because the ""food on the stove will get burned"". I guess not. I get the same treatment everytime and shamelessly go back. I have trouble gathering my thoughts about this, but I already hate one parent. I can't afford to hate mother too. ","It's okay to still love her but acknowledge that she can't be the comforting or loving parent you wish she could be. 

There is power in prioritizing your needs too. It's not selfish and it's completely healthy to need a take a break and set boundries from loved ones who take advantage of you. 

You will likely be gaslit, and feel like the bad guy. But it's important for you to surround yourself with people who respect you and give you what you need too."

This year in particular, is very hard... The beginning of the year was great, we just had our second son... but then it turned so fast.. I lost my 3+ jobs, we had an emergency vet bill, my first started school (been kinda rough) then car troubles, been dealing with some IRS issues since 2020 (which had drastically taken its toll), great grandpa's heart is failing, and now we've been served eviction papers. To top it off we do not have any family or friends near by to help.. Idk if this will make you feel any better but it could be worse....hang in there.."

Things have gotten a little better since I met my wife.  Her family is wonderful, and they've always been great to me.  It's not the same, but it's something, and I'll take it.  It's a shame that I can't cook for them this year as I usually do.  Instead, I have to make sure that 206 people and my staff have a great Thanksgiving over the course of six hours.

My mother is a narcissist and don't like talking to her she just makes things worse for me, my dad is a great hard working man he loves me and i love him too but i've disappointed him multiple times he has no expectations from me. I have only 4 friends that i talk to and i've never talked to a girl, i'm skinny very unattractive. i've broken soo many promises ""yeah, i'll do better next time"",""i'll start studying"",""i'll do this"",""i'll do that"" i did shit. I like playing video games and i'm not even good at that i play games like Call Of Duty and i just barely perform average. When i was a kid i really loved drawing it was like the best thing in the world for me, i used to think i was the best artist but my mother was just like ""eh"" and then i slowly slowly stopped drawing and then some months ago there is a kid in my school bus he is in like 5th or 6th grade and i saw his drawings and i was just absolutely stunned how great they were, he is much younger than me and he still draws better than me i just couldn't believe it. And to make things better my life fucked me bipolar disorder, i have it for almost a year now ever since then i just don't feel anything, i just sit in front of my laptop and waste time and i very rarely go out now, i've also failed my recent exams and now my parents are about to find that out and when they do they'll take away my laptop. I'm a very pathetic person and i've accomplished nothing in my life and i have no qualities whatsoever. i just don't know what am i doing or what should i do.

Edit: i might sound i'm over exaggerating but i needed this to get out of my brain.","here's what you should do: draw every day, look at art everyday, draw, draw, draw, because drawing is pleasure in itself, drawing has kept me alive, it keeps me alive, because it connects you to the world. it doesn't matter if you are good or not, just the drawing is what matters. what you can also do is learn about internal family systems therapy and start making friends with the part of you that is attacking you -- this part is trying to protect you, but is doing it in a painful way. 

with love,

I also used to draw when I was younger but now looking at all these people younger than me drawing amazing it makes me feel bad about myself and leads to me drawing only around once a year. 

I also play COD, i’m not the best, so if you just need someone to play with i’d be down to play with you. I got Cold War and Black Ops 6. 

I struggle with math as well, I often get shit for it from my mom. I do believe though that if we put in some time to study material we can do better. Also asking for help from teachers in class clears more understanding than accepting you’re confused. 

Failing exams is not the end of the world, but you can ask for more help next time and try and force yourself into learning material so you don’t end up feeling like you’re constantly breaking promises.

Sorry life is like this for you right now."

I'm scared that I don't want to get better,"Just recently started university. My first time away from home ever, it's been difficult, to say the least. I've been dealing with depression since junior high, and I always figured that THE feeling (THAT feeling, the one with dread, the one where you've acquainted yourself with all the horrible thoughts and feelings that make you feel like less of a human) would go away. Now, approaching 19 years old, I think this is the saddest I have ever been. I find my desire to live nonexistent, and just the thought of getting out of bed to use the restroom or brush my teeth is beyond daunting. It's not that I have plans to take my own life anytime soon (although i welcome the idea of death with open arms), but I find it harder and harder each day to find the motivation, or at this point discipline, to be a functioning member of society. 

I am terrified that a portion of this is just me not wanting to get better and I'm finding comfort in this state. I am horrified of this actually. I have never felt so helpless and confused in my entire life.  Does anyone else understand what I mean? Is this sadness all I know, and am I too scared to step away from it? Am I making this up? Am I just lazy? I don't want this for me, but I'm scared that this is the only life I can see for myself.","I definitely been where you are and I’m currently in that cycle. I don’t know how or what to say to aid you but please find one thing you enjoy & stick to it. I know lame as fuck advice but it works, like crocheting or coloring"

Why is it so hard to just be her friend ,"Im trying so hard to have her in my life and nomater what happens it fucks up every time

I met her a few months ago and immediately it felt like sparks were flying; we flirted a bunch and went as far as confessing we liked eachother, but as she had some remaining feelings for her last guy who was very on/off

I held onto my feelings for a while, then early November her last guy fully left so I made the mistake of telling her how I felt, and that created a whole issue where she didn't want me to talk to her while she was still very much in my friend group getting closer to my friends when I just wanted to be closer to her

Since the disagreement after I told her how I felt I've tried so hard to get rid of my feelings and honestly i have but I've held onto that hope that maybe one day we'll give it a go, it's the first girl I've been interested in in like 10 fucking years.

All this month she's been distant as anything with me, she says she values the friendship but we'd go from hot to cold legitimately daily. Then two weeks back she asks me to go on a walk with her and that went incredibly well, i didn't feel there was any awkwardness or anything it felt like the friendship started to grow again.

Then she went cold, I learned a few days later she's also met someone new, then asked for some space to think, then yesterday I get a lengthy message to say after she was given advice on things that I came on too fast, that I made her uncomfortable when my feelings for her manifested, and that multiple mutual friends have been in conversation about this whole thing but there's a lot of what she said that isn't true 

She said we're still friends but we will talk about this eventually, and it's left me absolutely furious. All I've tried for the last month was to be her friend I don't have strong feelings like I used to and im now left feeling absolutely fucking hurt

I hate this shit so bad, I fucking hate this ","It sounds like she has been upfront with you about how she feels. She doesnt want to hurt your feelings but doesnt want to lead you on either which would ultimately hurt your feelings more.

I know it sucks and this is just one of those situations everybody goes through. These things just take a little time. I would just try to avoid being around her if its going to keep bothering you. She hasnt done anything wrong, in fact it seems like she has been mature and respectful about it.

I also wouldnt torture yourself thinking there is something you can do to change her mind, it doesnt work that way and will just make things worse."
Never Taking Any Kind of Medicine,"Does anyone else have a thing where you never take medicine? Not even cold medicine or Ibuprofen. I've had a bad cold for the last four-ish days and not once have I considered just taking some cold medicine. And now that I have considered it, I still won't do it. I've been this way pretty much the entire time I've been old enough to administer medicine to myself. Last year when I had bronchitis and was approximately one hard cough away from hacking up a lung, I still didn't take any measures against it - no medicine, no humidifier treatments, no urgent care. I think it's a sort of self-harm thing; I know the medicine will probably make me feel better, but I'd rather tough it out and be miserable for days on end instead. I've just never been completely conscious of that decision until recently. ",Yeah this is definitely a form of self persecution. It’s the same principle as refusing to eat when you’re hungry as a form of punishment to oneself.

I am slowly getting better at taking responsibility for my life and the things I'm passionate about, but I wish I could just take a break.

I can't tell you it gets better, but there are many things out there that we can try to make things easier.

It's hard to be compassionate with yourself when you feel like everyone else knows what they're doing, and you're the only one dragging behind.

I can let you in on a little secret though. Most adults don't feel like adults. 

You don't stop being a child and a teenager when you get older. You carry all of these parts with you.

I started doing theater again and it's a blessing (when I manage to attend). Playing pretend, leaving the responsibility outside, it can be really healing.

Comfort is nice, but it doesn't move us forward towards a positive goal of some kind, and life has lots of accidents and tragedy and stuff, so the people who fail plan are the ones who are planning to fail. 

Life is hard, that's true, but you're capable of being strong enough to kick lifes ass. It's okay to be scared of adult life, believe me you're not the only one who's scared of it. At the same time though, don't be so afraid that you stop asking others for help.  Nobody is automatically an expert at life, we have to learn, and learning takes time. 

Also, when you get older you start to gain the ability to buy drugs and alcohol and other things that make you feel good, so there are still good things to look forward to. It's not just a whole lot of suffering in your future, there will be lots of good times too."

","🙂 You sound like my middle child. He's skinny, autistic, and is too hard on himself. He goes to therapy every single week and takes anti anxiety meds. He's also a beautiful child who deserves to be loved and supported, just like you. 

I hope one day soon you feel comfortable enough to open up to your parents about how you feel. 

It sounds like your parents are good and that you're afraid to burden or disappoint them. What I think is that they'll only be disappointed if they miss the opportunity to help you and find out later you suffered on your own. You are worth more than the price of a medication. You are worth more than the time it takes to go to and from a therapy appointment. You are worth listening to. You are worth helping. You are worth loving."

","There are many things about yourself that you dislike very much, such as being underweight, being shy, and having no friends.

But you also have loving and caring parents, which is something very valuable.

If you pass away, how would that affect your parents? Do you want to bring that kind of grief upon them knowingly?

Or would it be better to learn how to not suffer from these shortcomings? Once you learn how to do this, you still may be underweight and shy, but you won't suffer so much thinking about these things. Is this a state worth having?"

","Hey kid  , 

I’m sorry that you’re feeling this way. I think what you’re going through is mostly normal for a fair number of teenagers your age . Every teen goes through the “I hate myself “ and it’s totally normal to a certain extent . 
Your body is changing and sometimes it’s hard to keep up with it . You’re experiencing things and figuring out what you like and what you don’t like . All your current experiences are going to shape the adult that you’re going to become. So for the most part , it’s normal to feel lost. 

However , like a said , it’s perfectly normal to a certain extent . Every teen that goes through that phase needs all the support he can get . I would suggest you to talk to your parents about what you’re going through as I believe that they could help you the most and guide you at this important stage of your development . I also believe that you should definitely seek help from a therapist if you still feel this way after your talk to your parents. 

If you’re lucky to have supportive parents , they in theory would advise you to go see a psychiatrist and help you with what you need , especially if you’re the eldest kid and it’s their first time raising a teen going through that phase. 


I hope you the best of luck kid and really hope that you’re going to feel better one day . Don’t be afraid to talk to adults and to seek advice because it’s your first time living it and you’ll probably need help with many things that you’ll do for the first time . Talking is always the solution , never keep stuff that bothers you to yourself . Take that as your first life lesson . 

In the meantime , do what the parent in the first comment told you and go talk to your parents . If they truly care about you , they’ll go to therapy with you and would support you as much as they can . 

Keep your head up kid , life is worth living and things do get better . You just need to push through tough times. Much love and I’m here if you need someone to talk to . Peace ✌🏻."

","Op, now is the time to ask for help. 

Antidepressants are fairly affordable, it's therapy and other stuff that can be quite costly. 

You know what's also super costly? You dying.. 

To do anything from cremate to bury a body your starting costs are 10k +. Not to mention the mental and emotional scars that will haunt your parents.. wishing they did something differently.. missing you and having all this love with no where to go. Your pain will stop but it will shift on to your parents.

I promise you, your parents would rather pay for your antidepressants. 

You are worth more. 

I know it sounds like bs.  But this feeling won't last forever. I was your age when I didn't want to exist either. I know it's hard. But I also know you're strong af.

What ended up happening is I got help. I got on antidepressants.. and it saved my life. I lived way past when I thought I'd be gone. Now life is so beautiful I fear losing it.. it completely flipped. 

When you feel that way, I need you to do everything in your power to draw out the clock.. not today.. everyday until you don't feel that way. 

I promise you, life gets so much better. You'll find your people.. you'll make your mark.. you can experience happiness.. please please ask for help."

","Never worry about what your parents can or can’t afford when it comes to your mental health. My son did the same. You’d be amazed what us parents can do to help our children when it comes to their happiness. We move mountains for our kids. You have loving parents that will help you until the end of time. Go to them. Open up. Ask for help. There are resources almost everywhere in this world to help with medication costs and even if that’s not available in your area, they will figure it out and that mountain will be moved. Trust me. Please, do this for you and do this for your parents. There’s nothing worse for your parents than for them to live the rest of their lives without you in it."

","When I was around your age, my relationship with Jesus was like “I love Him but eh don’t really listen to Him”

Little did I know in 5 years I’d experience this intense anxiety and depression that would cause me to have the worldly urge to end myself. Jesus teaches that mortal sin, which if forgiveness isn’t sought for, puts someone in hell. (May God forbid this happens to any of His children in the future). Not wanting to go to hell and wanting to serve Him, I stayed. For me, things got better. My problems remained but I looked at them differently. Stay my friend."

I wish whoever thought of creating me never have done that because i'm simply a disappoitment to everyone and an abomination in eyes of God.",there is a life beyond school and the things evaluated by school arent necessarily at all the things you need to live a decent existence
Am I depressed or just lazy?,"I don't even know if I should post this on here, because I have no idea what I'm experiencing. I feel like I can't talk directly to others about this, because I feel incredibly ashamed about it. Over and over a thought keeps coming up in my mind. What if I'm just telling myself that I have depression, when I might actually just be really fucking lazy? Thing is, sometimes I still do things like laugh at memes or something like nothing was wrong and sometimes even doing something that's supposed to be fun, like playing videogames, seems too exhausting to me. Hell, even taking care of my dog, which we adopted only because of me I should add, feels bothersome to me (Which makes me feel like I'm the lowest scum in existence). I feel like a liar and a worthless parasite all the time, like I'm just making up excuses so I don't have to go to school or do other things. I've cut myself a lot, just because I felt like I wasn't suffering enough. Weirdly, doing that brought me an actual moment of relief and I couldn't help but genuinely smile when I did it.

- I still have the energy to watch videos on YouTube or look at memes, but lack the energy to do actual useful things.

- Wouldn't be the first time that I lied to not have to make an effort.",Hi friend. I would view this as depression. The fact that you feel hopeless in your future gives it away. I find people that are lazy to be content with their situation. You’re genuinely upset about it. At times we can feel overwhelmed and shut down. How is school/work?

Everything I think about myself is overwhelmingly negative, and I know that’s something many people with depression can relate to. 

Social expectations and stigma play a large role in why we think this about ourselves. Society also often associates productivity with self-worth. Symptoms of depression include excessive self-criticism and feelings of inadequacy. We give ourselves shit for not accomplishing various things, when our lack of motivation and energy is a direct result of our depression. 

I think you might believe you’re ""just lazy"" because you likely have a highly negative view of yourself, which is, again, a symptom of depression. It is just another negative thought amidst many of others. I think this specific thought sticks out for us because we feel that other people view us as lazy, and think that our depression is just an excuse not to get things done... like it isn't real. We start believing that ourselves. We often end up with other people's critical voices becoming our own.

Some people believe that depression is merely an excuse or a crutch to avoid facing everyday challenges, but this perspective stems from ignorance. There is a significant amount of stigma surrounding mental health as a whole.

People often use the word ""depressed"" casually to describe simply having a bad day, which, in my opinion, diminishes the true seriousness of depression in the eyes of the general public. The term is being misused.

I’m starting to realize that almost everyone who suffers with depression wonders if they’re ""just lazy."" This illness is so misunderstood, especially by those who haven’t experienced it firsthand.

This is one of my favorite quotes: ""It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.""

It makes me wonder whether my mental health struggles are rooted in my brain chemistry or if they are a direct result of trying to conform to societal norms that are fundamentally flawed.

I hope you get to laugh today."

Depression cause apparent lazyness.
Being lazy is choosing not to do anything consciously.
Depression is no longer doing anything sometimes. Even take care of your teeth or doing something you like. Or even drink and eat. You lack the will to.
You lack the meaning to.
You just are reduce to a meatbag that cant accomplish anything except see the worse in himself and others.


You feel like the world is against you. Like you cannot move. Stuck.
Hoping. And sometimes. Even if that is quite contrary.
Hating yourself enough to do something irreparable.


It is, really indeed.
Two completely different situations.


The lazy guy or girl could just choose to sit î a chair and have a nice time. Doing nothing.
The depressed. Doesn't control any of it."

I have no idea if, by writing this post, I'm just trying to convince myself that I'm depressed once again. 

To summarize, here's why I'm probably just lazy:

- I don't feel sad all the time. Sometimes I feel fine and forget these thoughts for some time.

- I still have the energy to watch videos on YouTube or look at memes, but lack the energy to do actual useful things.

- Wouldn't be the first time that I lied to not have to make an effort.","Your story sounds a lot like mine. While I’m not in a position to give you an official diagnosis, I do believe you suffer from some form of depression. I experience the same fight of “am I just lazy or am I actually struggling with a mental illness” and like has been mentioned here, a lack of hope for your future is a good sign it isn’t laziness that you’re fighting against. Some days won’t feel as tough as others because mental illness isn’t static. I don’t really have any words of encouragement for you. If I did it would just feel like lying. I’ve started seeing a therapist and I think you should too if you can. I don’t know if therapy is going to work for me but it may work for you and that’s reason enough in my opinion to suggest it. Best of luck to you in this world, my friend"

I find people that are lazy to be content with their situation.” I used to isolate myself, do the bare minimum for school, engage in too little physical activity, have way too much screen time, sometimes feel like an outcast that nobody liked but all in all I was ‘satisfied’ with living in my own little world. I could also still experience happiness. I didn’t feel hopeless about my future, I thought I would just make my way somehow. Back then I wouldn’t have thought that I was depressed but now I’m almost certain that the depression was already there. Sometimes you can become ‘lazy’ without being hopeless at first and aren’t aware that it is already a mild form of depression"

Many people are depressed because life isn’t going well for them or the goals they had they can’t achieve. Maybe the reason they cant achieve them is because they don’t put the effort in. Thus “lazy” is a label that can be used. So no matter how you view it we must put effort in our lives to feel a sense of accomplishment and this will fight the depression and remove the label of lazy.

I struggle with debilitating anxiety, and as a result, I’ve isolated myself more and more over the years. Unfortunately, all that has done is make it much worse. 

At one point, my social anxiety became so overwhelming that I couldn’t manage making a doctor’s appointment over the phone. I remember spending days crying and having panic attacks over the prospect of making a simple call. 

Being socially awkward is tough, but all my isolation has done is deepen my feelings of loneliness and make my anxiety more difficult to manage. Getting out into the world/interacting with people is the best thing I could do for myself at this point."

what’s the point of living if i have no life to live ,"everyone around me has so many friends,and goes out and does things and are making a life for themselves. while i sit in my bed and pity myself. how pathetic can i really be? i have no friends i dont get out of my house ever. like i said everyone around me is going out and doing things and working hard on school. while i do online school and not even smart enough to comprehend most of it.im going to court because of it too. also its so hard for me to just get out of bed and do it. i just want to lay in my bed and rot away into mold like most of the dishes in my room. i cant even clean my room,how can i manage to live adult life? i’m so nervous for the future. i don’t want to end up like my dad,but that’s what im letting myself come to sadly. i tried so hard to get out of this hole i was in only to just fall back in. ",I absolutely agree!
I Finally Asked For Help! *tw*,"I finally sent the email, which was sitting in my drafts for weeks. I don't know how to feel. I've been wanting to get help for years but was always too scared. I'm scared of changing. I don't know how else to live. Ever since I could remember I've been this way. Scared of everything and everyone, even myself sometimes. As years went by, I slowly got used to it. It felt strange, not constantly feeling strange. But these last couple of years have been hardcore. It felt like I was drowning always. I could never breathe properly. So, I had to do things that would let me breathe, even for a little bit. Alcohol, cigarettes, pornography, self-harming. I did it all, But I'm done. I can't do this anymore, I'm tired. Really fucking tired. I can't do this on my own anymore, the more I tell myself I'm ok by myself the worse it gets. Man, it's time to get my shit together.","I'm proud of you. Asking for help is a huge step to take and you've pushed yourself to finally do it.

Sounds like you are about to get that shit together."

Whenever I have to get a new therapist (I move a lot) I always ask if they are comfortable telling me I'm wrong or telling me no. I let them know that sometimes I can go into ""fight"" mode which for me is being mean to people or causing drama when I feel threatened/sad.

Who I am is not what I did, and what I did is not who I am... and yet.

I wish I could take back what I did, because I hurt someone who never deserved to be hurt, and I can truthfully say I am sorry for that, and have never repeated what I did again, nor will I.

I might be depressed? I don't know...,"I, personally think I might be bipolar or maybe puberty is just hitting again but... Hi, I'm a young teenager named Ari (nickname of sorts). I feel like I shouldn't even be here because I haven't lived long enough to have even felt the pain of being a full grown adult yet. Anyway, I feel like I'm a burden on my family and more specifically my mother. She's a kind, energetic, but stern disabled black woman (do to herniated disk and getting it removed mess with her brain connection to her legs) that's admitted to be bipolar. She doesn't hesitate to call me out on things and express what she's feeling (even if it hurts) example: she has told me that I've made her regret having children and she even told people not to. But being a single mother that's been heart broken many times and trauma from both her mother and the people around her mother, that's understandable. Me on the other hand? I've never had a traumatic even in my life! I'm great! There's nothing for me to worry about in life other than keeping things tidy and going to high school! And that's what's bugging me actually... You see, i've never had to worry about anything to serious other than my mother's failing body and my sister who's being mistreated by my blood father in my entire life. I feel like I should have something to worry about, like my life is too lean for someone who messes up as badly as I do. I feel like I'm a serious burden in everyone's life, the bad overpowers the good. No matter what I do it ends up wrong or bad somehow. In short, I feel like I don't deserve my life and someone else should take my role as a better son, I've prayed for this to happen before too despite staying neutral on the religion thing. And honestly, as dumb as it sounds through text, I've contemplated killing myself many times and even told my mother once, I haven't killed myself because of my sister because if I kill myself she can't come home because CPS would point a finger at my mother for it. And I have bad mood swings, they're never good unless if my friends bug me enough to take my mind off things. It's always from bubbly to that one depressed quiet kid you probably shouldn't want to sit by. And at this point I've stabbed myself multiple times with sharp objects and played the knife game with an actual knife to scold myself now that my mother is to crippled to do it herself. In short, sayori in real life",If anyone has any thoughts on my predicament I'd love to read them

Around this time 3 years ago,"My life was flipped upside down. I'm laying in my bed crying because I don't understand how I can still miss a life that was probably a lie. It feels awful to still feel completely stuck and broken. I was so smart and I always felt like I could do anything. Now it feels like I can't do anything. It feels like I'm drinking and drugging myself to death. My liver is enlarged and I'm only 41. I hate that I have to wake up every day because people will miss me. I just wish something would end this. Nothing feels good anymore. I was left to wither away, and I am doing just that.","3 years ago I was still dating ""the one"" and 5 years ago was the happiest year of my life. But things get better and different.

Sibling with mental issues. I feel sympathetic but angry with him at the same time. How can I cope.,"I know my older brother (36m) has had a mental illness for many years. I (33f) think it’s depression but I’m not sure whether he is also diagnosed with something else.

He always blame his circumstances in life to my poor family, despite my parents love him so much. 

During my adult life, I have been travelling a lot for work, and he would send me messages to complain about his life and want to kill himself /kill other people…. I have been consoling him as much as I could and showed him how much I loved him. 

He never asked me how I was. Always just about himself. (Although when he is in a better mood, sometimes he would share something about his hobbies with me. I tried to hype him up when he was in a good mood.)

Now I’m pregnant, and still, not once did he ask me how I am, but keep sending negative messages about himself to me. 

I’m so sick of this kind of negativity. It’s been impacting me since I was a teenager. I feel like Im only a trash bin for his emotions. I feel like I was emotionally manipulated all the time. I made me feel not loved. 

Now I’m trying to start my own family. I want to ignore him and cut him out, but my conscience tells me to keep caring for him - which may upset me more…

I don’t know how I can cope. I feel angry, guilty and sad. Has anyone had experience dealing with toxic family members as well?

Tl:dr: My older brother always sent me negative things about his life. He never once asked me how I am. Its impacting my mood as my pregnancy also makes it worse. How can I cope?",Different but I understand where you are coming from. My needs were always ignored compared to my sister. When she was depressed so was I but my mother only cared about her. What helped for me was taking space. Viewing our interactions less like family and more like business obligations. My sister and I are very good friends now and she's in a lot better of a place. My parents are fine. I'm being vague but all I'm saying is don't feel guilty for prioritizing yourself. I didn't talk to my parents for over a year and the guilt ate away but ultimately they are now a lot kinder to me because they know my relationship to them has limits.
Sibling with mental issues. I feel sympathetic but angry with him at the same time. How can I cope.,"I know my older brother (36m) has had a mental illness for many years. I (33f) think it’s depression but I’m not sure whether he is also diagnosed with something else.

He always blame his circumstances in life to my poor family, despite my parents love him so much. 

During my adult life, I have been travelling a lot for work, and he would send me messages to complain about his life and want to kill himself /kill other people…. I have been consoling him as much as I could and showed him how much I loved him. 

He never asked me how I was. Always just about himself. (Although when he is in a better mood, sometimes he would share something about his hobbies with me. I tried to hype him up when he was in a good mood.)

Now I’m pregnant, and still, not once did he ask me how I am, but keep sending negative messages about himself to me. 

I’m so sick of this kind of negativity. It’s been impacting me since I was a teenager. I feel like Im only a trash bin for his emotions. I feel like I was emotionally manipulated all the time. I made me feel not loved. 

Now I’m trying to start my own family. I want to ignore him and cut him out, but my conscience tells me to keep caring for him - which may upset me more…

I don’t know how I can cope. I feel angry, guilty and sad. Has anyone had experience dealing with toxic family members as well?

Tl:dr: My older brother always sent me negative things about his life. He never once asked me how I am. Its impacting my mood as my pregnancy also makes it worse. How can I cope?","Thank you for your advice. I am happy that you found an approach that works out great. I also think taking spaces will be better for my mental health, but i worry ignoring my brother will make him feel abandoned."
I don’t understand why other people want to live I feel like I’m doing something wrong,"I can’t understand why we bother to live for so long. Not once have I ever sat down and thought “I’m so glad I didn’t kill myself” even if I’m having a “good time” or not in a bad mood. It’s unbearable, I hate that I can’t turn my brain off. I’ve been like this since about 8 I’m not sure I’ll ever get very old but that’s ok with me.","Heya! You asked why people bother to live for long, right? I would say curiosity has a part to play, like a rollercoaster. You for example don't leave a rollercoaster before it's over, even if you at times find it boring. That's because you're locked in for the ride, just to see where it goes and how it ends. 

Sometimes there is even suprising shifts in the path, that changes you, right now you're just at the stale part of the rollercoaster, if you get the analogy. Things will change for the better, if you stick it out."
It won’t get better,"I know I’m gonna get those comments like oh it gets better, people love you and that it would be selfish to end it all, I’ve been suffering for 15 years ( I am 27 ) spent years in therapy, years on medication, I have no job, no friends, most of my family hate me, still live with my parents, no grades and the desire to just end it all gets stronger and stronger, my therapist always told me it gets easier? That’s a load of crap because it’s only got more difficult, the likelyhood is that if I live I’ll live with my parents until they pass, then I’ll end up homeless because the local government won’t give me a place and my siblings hate me, my physicical and mental health has made it so I can’t leave the house for years on end, I have to pay a stupid amount just to get any qualifications since I’d have to retake all of my GCSE’s so really what is the point? Again people are gonna say it gets better and that I just have to stick it out and the common one that if I kill myself im selfish to those around me, but surely it’s more selfish for you to tell me this, you only say it to feel better about yourself, how is any of this fair on me? That I should live so other people aren’t sad? What about my happiness? Sorry I needed to vent because I have no one to talk to about this.","It actually doesn't get easier and I hate when people say that too. However it does ebb and flow. Some days, months years, are awful, but others are good. You seem really stuck to me, I've been there too before and am currently in a sticky era. But you will come out of it. What do you want? What would make things better?"

I'm on paxil now and it helps make me not cry every day lol. But other than that I feel most the same downs as normal. If those things didn't make you happy that's ok. They don't have to. I feel happy when I see cute puppies on the street disobey their owners or when I watch a really cool indie sci-fi movie that makes me think. There's joy in little things. The rest is sort of bullshit noise that society makes us deal with. Do you have friends still? Sometimes just telling them you love them and are proud of them can help make your friendships better. I'm so grateful for mine and they are always there when I'm low. I never feel like a burden cuz I'm there for them too
…,"I cant cry. I havent cried like a years sometimes tear comes from my eye but it doesnt feel likea anything.

I'm sorry you feel sad.
the feeling when things feel to good,you know that feeling when life starts to feel good again and you feel maybe it will get better only for it to get worse so much worse then last time i hate it that's why when i feel like life is going good i get pretty on edge knowing for a fact something is about to fuck it all up i hate it ,"Things ebb and flow, that's the definition of life.

So when I have a ""good"" day, I know a very very bad day is ahead of me."
It’s been 12 years…,"She probably thinks I’ve moved on by now.

More realistically, she probably doesn’t even think about me at all.

The truth is, I still love and miss her every day and hate life without her.

Every place I go feels emptier without her presence, like the world has been drained of its color.

I wonder if she ever sees something that reminds her of me, or if I’ve already faded from her memory like a distant dream.

Nights are the hardest—when silence grows loud, and the weight of her absence feels unbearable.

But maybe that’s what I deserve—to be forgotten by the only person I can’t let go of.

Sometimes, I catch myself talking to the ghost of her, whispering apologies to the air, hoping some fragment of her soul might hear me.

The worst part is, I don’t even know who I am anymore without her. She took the best of me when she left.

I replay the past in my mind like a broken record, searching for the exact moment I lost her, as if finding it could somehow bring her back.

Every morning I wake up, and for a split second, I forget she’s gone. But then it hits me, harder each time, like an old wound torn open.

The world keeps turning, indifferent to the hollow ache inside me, and I’m left here, wondering how something so beautiful could ever slip through my fingers.",Take a breath man it’s ok hyper fixation on a person could be a sign of something else trust me I know how it feels.
Selfish of me to live?,"I feel as though I bother everyone. I ruin everyone’s life including my fiance and my family. I thought all the money in the world could help me be happy, but it doesn’t. I don’t deserve to happy and I don’t look for it. My happiness always came from doing amazing things with my family and friends but now I find myself at a crossroad. I believe it’d more selfish of me to live, I just annoy and bother and argue with everyone all the time. I don’t want to, I just do and I can’t see a positive to living. I know I’ll be punished in the afterlife but I agree with it, God should punish me for torment I have caused and for taking my own life. Theres no positive to me living (others perspective), I’d want to live and be with family but I can’t. I bother too much, I just can’t live knowing I’m such a nuisance. I’m sorry for venting, I just don’t know what to do  ",Tell your fiance this. Tell your family this. It is so obvious to me that you are loved and it's ok to lean on others. Tell them why you love them and they will tell you why they love you back

What’s the right way to deal with this?,"I’m at a dilemma with dealing with my depression. Today is thanksgiving and I live with my sister. My sisters friend invited me to her house where I won’t know majority of the people. Keep in mind socializing with people that I do know drains me for a period of time. 

I know that isolating can be bad for depression, but I just have no motivation and am not excited to go spend multiple hours around people I’m not too familiar with .. also my car is in the shop so I can’t just leave early , I’m there at the mercy of when the driver wants to leave. I don’t want to be rude and and not show, but I also don’t want to show up, just to kind of be withdrawn and awkward, I just don’t feel like my normal bubbly self. I’d rather just stay home. What should I do in situations like this?","Are you able to be honest with your sister and tell her how unsettling this commitment is for you?

If you can't, you might have to get a sudden onset of stomach ache or flu like symptoms, if you get my drift...

Ideally, I should tell you to push through and go as you may even enjoy yourself but that's too easy for me to say when I'm not in your shoes."
How can I change my mindset? ,"I made some mistakes and tried to correct them. I went into it with the mindset that I could admit to anything because I was going to kill myself anyway. The people I spoke to were understanding and told me to move on. I was happy for a while, but now I am scared that they will expose my mistakes to everyone else.

Now to my question. Since I was 14 years I wanted to kill myself. A lot of it has to do with my upbringing and the fact that I was practically brought up in a religious cult. I think that is why I went on and admitted everything in the hope of washing my sins clean. I sabotage myself a lot because of this belief. 

Also, I usually worry a lot about my future and have anxiety, so my steps are very thought out. When I'm depressed, I just do things and don't worry about the consequences. So when I sleep and eat a bit after such a hard time and somehow look forward to the next day, I think about all the mistakes I've made in my depressed state and go back to wanting to kill myself. 

How do I get out of this? ","Depression loves to dig up your worst fears and make them feel huge, but it’s lying to you. This isn’t the end, even if it feels like it. Start small. Focus on eating something decent, resting, and just making it through today. You don’t have to figure out everything all at once. and therapy could help you unpack the guilt and fear you’re carrying."

I need help. Huge TW ,"I am seriously considering suicide right now. This all started in June. My husband cheated on me with transgender hookers. I was 7 months pregnant at the time and he gave me an std which is cleaned up now. We did ivf to conceive our baby, so I was distraught because we had put a year of work into the process and for him to have sex with someone else and risk our baby’s health and mine is disturbing. Anyways, during this time he started to get really abusive. He was mainly emotionally abusive but a few times he did choke me out and throw me on the bed. We argued and screamed and I cried a lot. I became severely depressed. I had my son recently . I love him so much. He is truly the best baby and I would go to the ends of the world for him. I had serious complications with my c section, I almost went septic, needed more surgery, ended up staying in the hospital for a few weeks after, and I have a huge wound. I still have an open wound and it’s impacting me a lot and my ability to function normally. My husband has a drinking problem and it’s gotten increasingly worse. He drinks all day. At work at home everything. I am getting very exhausted and overwhelmed. All I do is take care of our baby. I stay at home and I’m with him all day. And then I’m up all night with him. I get maybe three hours of sleep a night. My husband tells me it’s my kid and my responsibility so he shouldn’t have to do anything for the baby. He went as far as saying he didn’t even want him, which is ironic because we paid thousands for me to even get pregnant but okay. It’s so hurtful. I am so exhausted. I don’t sleep. I don’t eat. I’m a mess. I have bipolar and anxiety, and I’ve been managing it great for years but I’m starting to get severely depressed. I also have 4 years sober from drugs. So seeing my husband drink daily and cause me pain is so triggering too. I would never relapse because of my son, but without him I would use in a minute. My husband has started to physically hurt me too. He’s been punching, strangling me, pushing my head into the bed so I can’t breathe, pushing me against the wall and to the floor, the list goes on. He’s emotionally and verbally and financially abusive too. I stay at home and take care of our baby and I don’t work so he’s been using that against me lately as well. He tells me he hates me daily, he describes how he wants me to die. He tells me to choke on my vomit and drown myself. I know I sound psychotic for still being with him. But it’s so sad, I love him dearly still. We wanted this life so badly, I don’t want to give him up.

We’re supposed to have thanksgiving at ours tomorrow and I feel physically sickened. I do not want to be alive. I do not have the energy to take care of my son or myself tonight. And I don’t think I have it in me to make it through tonight. Someone please help me because I am going to have a mental breakdown. I know everyone’s going to say leave him but I don’t want to. I am scared, I love him, I wanted our life together to work out. I’m truly freaking out.

I need help. Huge TW ,"I am seriously considering suicide right now. This all started in June. My husband cheated on me with transgender hookers. I was 7 months pregnant at the time and he gave me an std which is cleaned up now. We did ivf to conceive our baby, so I was distraught because we had put a year of work into the process and for him to have sex with someone else and risk our baby’s health and mine is disturbing. Anyways, during this time he started to get really abusive. He was mainly emotionally abusive but a few times he did choke me out and throw me on the bed. We argued and screamed and I cried a lot. I became severely depressed. I had my son recently . I love him so much. He is truly the best baby and I would go to the ends of the world for him. I had serious complications with my c section, I almost went septic, needed more surgery, ended up staying in the hospital for a few weeks after, and I have a huge wound. I still have an open wound and it’s impacting me a lot and my ability to function normally. My husband has a drinking problem and it’s gotten increasingly worse. He drinks all day. At work at home everything. I am getting very exhausted and overwhelmed. All I do is take care of our baby. I stay at home and I’m with him all day. And then I’m up all night with him. I get maybe three hours of sleep a night. My husband tells me it’s my kid and my responsibility so he shouldn’t have to do anything for the baby. He went as far as saying he didn’t even want him, which is ironic because we paid thousands for me to even get pregnant but okay. It’s so hurtful. I am so exhausted. I don’t sleep. I don’t eat. I’m a mess. I have bipolar and anxiety, and I’ve been managing it great for years but I’m starting to get severely depressed. I also have 4 years sober from drugs. So seeing my husband drink daily and cause me pain is so triggering too. I would never relapse because of my son, but without him I would use in a minute. My husband has started to physically hurt me too. He’s been punching, strangling me, pushing my head into the bed so I can’t breathe, pushing me against the wall and to the floor, the list goes on.

At work at home everything. I am getting very exhausted and overwhelmed. All I do is take care of our baby. I stay at home and I’m with him all day. And then I’m up all night with him. I get maybe three hours of sleep a night. My husband tells me it’s my kid and my responsibility so he shouldn’t have to do anything for the baby. He went as far as saying he didn’t even want him, which is ironic because we paid thousands for me to even get pregnant but okay. It’s so hurtful. I am so exhausted. I don’t sleep. I don’t eat. I’m a mess. I have bipolar and anxiety, and I’ve been managing it great for years but I’m starting to get severely depressed. I also have 4 years sober from drugs. So seeing my husband drink daily and cause me pain is so triggering too. I would never relapse because of my son, but without him I would use in a minute. My husband has started to physically hurt me too. He’s been punching, strangling me, pushing my head into the bed so I can’t breathe, pushing me against the wall and to the floor, the list goes on. He’s emotionally and verbally and financially abusive too. I stay at home and take care of our baby and I don’t work so he’s been using that against me lately as well. He tells me he hates me daily, he describes how he wants me to die. He tells me to choke on my vomit and drown myself. I know I sound psychotic for still being with him. But it’s so sad, I love him dearly still. We wanted this life so badly, I don’t want to give him up. He just fucking projectile vomited everywhere in our room bc he’s so drunk and I just had to clean it up for like an hour, while taking care of my baby. And to top that shit off I saw messages between him and more trans/and non trans hookers with him trying to do another meetup. We have sex daily. What the fuck is he thinking. I’m his fucking wife and the mother of his child. I don’t know what to do. Writing this and semi processing it made it ten times worse than just being in my head.

Sometimes, you just have to take some simple steps to focus on. Take a short walk. Solve a crossword. Treat yourself to something you normally don't. I do believe things change even slowly, but they do. I read somewhere a woman wrote her first book at 82. Challenge yourself to try something that isn't you. Lift weights. Hold a yoga pose til you can't any longer."

Chronic illness depression ,I’ve been struggling with some unknown chronic illness for months now and I am feeling so helpless and beat. I lie in bed every day and barely move. If this is my life now it’s no life I want to live . I’ve started medication a few days ago but only seeming to make me worse . Fuck this . ,It's hard feeling like shot daily and not knowing what's causing it. I struggled for years with symptoms and no doctor could seem to pin point it. I finally got one of my diagnosises two years ago and have been in treatment. Feel free tp reach out if you wanted to discuss more privately your symptoms.

I want to go to sleep and not wake up ,"I'm so sorry for this grim post, but I'm really struggling to stay alive each day.
I've struggled with depression on and off for about 12 years, but I've had frequent bouts of feeling ""rock bottom"" this year.
This last two weeks has probably been the worst. I wake up every day and instantly feel sick. I don't want to be here. I constantly want to cry. I feel like I don't want to be around anyone because I don't want to subject them to my misery. 
The only thing that has stopped me from killing myself so far is my dog. But today I've even researched if dogs can carry on a happy life when their owner dies. 
I've thought about how I'd do it and planned it out in my head. 
I just don't know what to do anymore. I can't go on feeling like this.
I've tried talking therapy which didn't serve much help. I've been on meds for 12 years. I can't afford to go privately for further therapy. Nothing helps.

I don't even know why I'm posting this. I guess I just want to get all my thoughts down and wondered if anyone else feels like this. 
I'm sorry if this triggers anyone or upsets anyone 😥",Can relate. Have ever tried medication

Wish I could help - I've tried everything for years.  I just hate myself and judge myself for every move I make.   I'd drink, but it doesn't help much, and makes things unbelievably worse for the next few days.     Thank you for reminding me that I'm not the only one, like some freak of nature."

You’re not a freak at all. The opposite actually. 
They say the most intelligent people suffer from depression. But sometimes I wish I wasn’t so “knowing” about things, if you know what I mean. Ignorance is bliss as they say. 

Do you find this holiday season exacerbates the feelings too? I’m feeling at rock bottom and with Christmas around the corner, it amplifies everything. 

All we can do is keep going. Hour by hour if we have to. We’ve got this together 💪🏼"

The only thing that has stopped me from killing myself so far is my dog. But today I've even researched if dogs can carry on a happy life when their owner dies. 
I've thought about how I'd do it and planned it out in my head. 
I just don't know what to do anymore. I can't go on feeling like this.
I've tried talking therapy which didn't serve much help. I've been on meds for 12 years. I can't afford to go privately for further therapy. Nothing helps.

I don't even know why I'm posting this. I guess I just want to get all my thoughts down and wondered if anyone else feels like this. 
I'm sorry if this triggers anyone or upsets anyone 😥","Thank you so much for responding.   I don't get many e-mails, so I was happy to see yours.....  About the holidays, all I feel is that I wish they were over, same as every year.  I don't have kids, maybe that's why.   So sorry about the negative thoughts; they're impossible to stop, but I guess that's part of depression, unfortunately.    Keeping busy does help, but with no energy & very little sleep, how long can anyone keep this up?   Do you have trouble feeling happiness about anything?   Your letter makes me feel very supported, in a world where no one can understand unless they actually have this.      I do know  a lot of people who don't care about Christmas, so not so unusual.   It's great if you're a little kid, I guess."
It will be better they said,"Just here to vent about what's on my mind.

I can't seem to keep quiet about this. I'm too weak to bottle it up or ""just feel better"" because everything could be worse or there is someone that has it worse than me. I am here to let go of what's on my mind because I can no longer keep quiet about this.

I am a 14 year old male from Philippines. I don't know why but the daily frustrations I feel from my 49 year old mother just keeps adding up and I feel that if I keep quiet for any longer I might go mad or have an emotional breakdown. 

I am having a bit issues with my mother, calling me ""batugan"" ""demonyo"" ""walang kuwenta"" ""masamang anak"", all meaning useless demon child and etc. This only happens about once a week whenever she's stressed about something and I can't do anything to lighten her load of being a mother.

 It may be true that I'm a useless demon child for not helping around the house more than I do now and having a shit temper whenever I feel insulted or disregarded in any way. I have no reason to be mad about all this because even though my mother doesn't verbally apologize for the hurtful things she say to me, she apologizes by spending time with me outside and eating together and giving me my favorite foods.

 I recognize her efforts to give me a comfortable life, and I want to give my best to return it in any way I can, but whenever she has these kinds of episodes where she just lashes out at me for something she started or something I can't do anything about, it makes me want to take back my desire to be a good son because of how frustrated she makes me feel and the fact I can't do anything about it without causing a bigger problem and essentially digging my own grave and my mother's. 

She's already very sick for her age and has health of an 80 year old. She a weak heart and has hypertension so bad she could have a fatal heart attack at any moment, and diabetes so bad her body is deteriorating, causing nerves to basically decay. Despite all this, she still defies the advice of her doctor and start dieting to stay healthy and instead eats so much sugar and fat she's practically killing herself. My mother keeps using the excuse ""kung mamatay edi patay"" or ""if I'm gonna die why would I die restricted from what I like"". 

Her basically throwing away her life makes me feel like she's disregarding me and not caring if I have to live without a mother and a father working abroad 9 months a year just so we don't starve. And the more my mother keeps calling me names and pushing me away, the more I feel like I'm truly undeserving of the unconditional love of a mother. I am afraid I truly am how she describes me. I am afraid that my mother might not live long enough to even see me graduate. I am afraid to have to live without 2 parents. I am afraid that I'm turning out to be a failure and a mistake like how I was made.

I'm aware there are people who have it worse than me, and there are people in this subreddit that feel worse than me but I'm weak. I'm not sure if I want to continue to see how I turn out. I'm not sure if I can.. I don't have anyone to talk to.. I don't deserve.... I can't even.....","It's ok you feel the way you do. Sometimes life is hard and it's even harder to see the good parts. You can tell your mom your feelings are hurt, maybe she'll listen. Tell her when she's in a good mood. I'm sorry your dad is far away. When I was your age I didn't help enough around the house either. Now that I'm older, whenever I visit home I clean and do the dishes, certain things come with maturity and age and it's hard to remember being a teen like yourself when you're 50 like your mom. Her health thing also resonates with me cuz once again my mom is the same. When I was your age I felt hopelessness and had no plans for my future, but now I find beauty in the little things and it's given me a lot of peace. To view the world with childlike joy, to look at pretty clouds and little bugs and stars. It all feels overwhelming now and some days in the future it will feel like this too but it's ok because other days are fun with laughter and joy and good food and pretty views. You will get through this tough time and make an amazing life for yourself."
I'm wasting my life-vent,"I made my first post here yesterday just tj get stuff off my chest about how I feel and stuff, basically saying how I feel unmotivated and sad every morning and cry every night, I've not been to school once this week and I don't think Im going to go back ever, my parents are fine with it if I get a job instead which is fair enough, because I don't want to rot away in my room all day, but I hope leaving school will start to help me feel better","Idk which country you are but think about graduating highschool at least. I also skipped school a lot and my parents let me. I studied at home and went in for tests. I HATED school but school isn't work and I think you'll like working. That said high school graduation helps with getting jobs and if you are ever crazy like me and decide to become a scientist, you need it to go to college. And college still is kind of sucky cuz it's still school but it's different in a good way. All this to say, maybe try and finish and then work, future you may thank you."

Trees don’t have purpose. Whales don’t either. Or dogs etc. They simply exist in the present and that’s enough for them, what about you?” No one weeps for a dying star but they burn brightly anyway. 

I dunno. Hitting my brain back with “yeah of course in the grand scale nothing matters except what’s right in front of you and the people close by” often jolts me out of it when I’m having really severe ideations. For me there’s power in feeling the right sort of small. But I feel like that reframe isn’t for everyone cus it’s a little intense. Maybe it’ll do something for you tho! 

Either way I feel you. Deff not alone in thinking and feeling this."

I don't think this assumption holds true. There isn’t something you must pursue to justify your life. For instance, food is more fundamental than money; you earn money to buy food. It wouldn’t make sense to stop eating just because eating doesn’t bring you more money. To me, life is simply life. It’s not a tool or a means to achieve something else. Instead, it’s always the other way around.

I am not happy at all, but I don't see happiness as something higher either. For that reason, I just maintain the status quo. I haven’t shaved for a month (maybe longer, who knows or cares) — why bother with something as drastic as suicide?"

A lie, so I stay quiet and suffer in silence. Isolated from any friends an intimate relationships. I just feel alone & lost like there's absolutely no way out and things keep getting worse. I didn't think things could get any worse but they do. I've lost every single thing I love all I have is my dog left & he needs me more then I need him. I'm falling apart I don't know how to make all the continuous hurt & trauma if I try to explain it you simply cannot understand it fully unless you see it for your actual self actively. No one believes me unless I show them I can't tell people because they think I'm paranoid & crazy. Until they actively see it first hand & experience some if it for they're own eyes I sound delusional. How do you get help when it's like that... how can anything get better I'm so lost..","Nah bro im not invalidating you at all, im trying to show you that it can always be worse. There’s someone big I forgot their name that says

Don’t look too much at those in front nor, look always at the people who don’t have as much as you. That always helps.

But I’m sorry if it came across as if I was invalidating your feelings"

Walking Alone,"I am currently nine weeks pregnant and the father of my child wants nothing to do with me. 

After months of an abusive relationship, he has managed to escape all accountability and make everything about himself. He has framed the picture so that he is the one who needs all the time and space to heal, while telling me to go through this pregnancy mostly alone and only call him for the appointments. 

He wants this baby more than I do at this point. I went into this wanting to create a family, and instead he has left me on my own. This is my first pregnancy and it has been nothing but pain and suffering since the day we found out. I have done everything I could to make this work between us, and he has decided that I am simply not good enough except for to give him this child.

I honestly am not excited about any of it anymore. I don’t even want to have a baby shower or gender reveal. And I am talking with my family to consider all of my options. I want a family one day, but I refuse to have it with somebody who is going to Push me away and leave me out to dry when I’m in one of the most vulnerable situations I’ve ever encountered.

He wants space in time because he doesn’t know how to deal with me or my emotions. So he can have all the time in the world. I am done, and after I give birth, I am going to do what is best for me and this child. ","If he isn’t going to support the baby while it’s growing inside of you - do you think he will support the baby outside of you? If he doesn’t support you at all rn - how is going to support a child who is half of you?
If he doesn’t want to support you with your emotions or mental health - do you believe he will be able to emotionally support a baby who can only communicate through crying, cooing and screaming? And for the first time- 4yrs the child can’t control impulsive behaviour and cannot emotionally regulate until ~8yrs old. 
Do what is best for you. Care for yourself- no one else can do that for you. 
I encourage you to seek help.
I’m wish you nothing but the best. 
It may be difficult now- things will change <3"

can’t stop thinking about killing myself over small things,"hey
super depressing topic I guess but I was wondering if anyone else struggled with small things setting them over the edge.

I’m in a really bad place life wise rn. I moved back home with my parents and two siblings, and am working a job where I’m being bullied by colleagues.
I’m trying to save so I can move cities and am also looking for a job in this new city.

Being home is unbearable. My parents house is a cluttered mess (they’re hoarders) and it’s a stereotypical living in a house of undiagnosed mental illness. Essentially it’s a pit.
The last few weeks I can’t stop thinking about killing myself and it seems to be the small things pushing me over the edge.

A family member using the bathroom in the morning during the time I usually use it. The main thing lately has been that my siblings room is underneath mine. I try to sleep at around 10/11pm each night but ever since winter has come (sibling used to stay out til 1/2am) they are always home and at around 9:30pm he will be on the phone for hours and then when he falls asleep I can hear him snoring.
The insulation is this house is shocking and all I can hear at night is snoring.
I’ve asked him and my parents to ask him to be quieter and to get tested for sleep apnea/ use more pillows.

But every night I just hear non-stop low grumbling from his talking and then loud snores and it’s impossible to sleep. I’ve tried earbuds but they hurt my ears when I lie on my side and I got a rug but it hasn’t helped much with the sound.
I’ve been relying on drinking a bit too much for my liking lately but I just feel like a string pulled too tight ready to snap.
Ive been complaining to my mom about the sound and what I believe is sensory overload but she will always just respond with okay and it makes me so angry.

I just want to go away and never come back ever again.
I want to love cities and get a new job but my fear that my new job will be like the one I’m currently in scares me especially with the financial insecurity.

I just feel trapped and like the only way out is to die. Lately I’ve been coming up with plans and tbh it terrifies me. Though I’ve always struggled I’ve always considered myself strong and able to see the light but it feels like things have just become so bleak that I can’t stand being alive anymore. ","I don't believe it's small things. It's a lot of built up things into one huge pile. Of course those things would bother you, it would bother anyone. Are you able to get more comfortable headphones since it seems like your mom is not willing to help?"
I want to get worse,I want to get more worse than I already am so the people that have done me wrong can feel bad for me. Ik that sounds awful but I just can’t help it. I want the girl that made my life miserable for months to look at me and feel bad for me. I feel like shit for thinking like this though ,"I hate to say it, but these people won't feel bad,as alot of people in this word are truly just selfish and totally lack the ability to have any kind of empathy..Sad but unfortunately true."

I feel like shit for thinking like this though ,"If it’s depression that you’re hoping will get worse, please believe me, you do not. As someone with clinical depression ranging at times from mild to severe, this disease can steal your ability to function. 

Don’t sabotage your health to get back at someone that probably won’t care.

We all get these kinds of thoughts from time to time so don’t feel bad for thinking it. You can’t always help how you feel. I think the better revenge is to get well and live a good life. Show her she can’t affect you anymore."

I want the girl that made my life miserable for months to look at me and feel bad for me. I feel like shit for thinking like this though ,"Honestly that's fair. When people have hurt me in the past I have wanted the same thing for a sense of acknowledgement and accountability on their part. The issue is that when people hurt you and don't take accountability, they usually don't see you being in a vulnerable state as a consequence of their actions. Some people see it as gratifying because they believe they were the victim and they might pervieve your vulnerability as karma. In other cases, seeing you in a worse off place can make them feel better about their own position in life. And in other cases, they may have hurt you because they simply have no consideration for you and seeing you in a bad spot would not even be longer than a second thought for them. It helped me to redirect my energy into people who have been kind to me. What would those people think and what would they hope for me. They would most likely hope that I'm healthy, happy and enjoying life. Those people are more deserving of my efforts than those who have hurt me. Instead of trying to prove that people who hurt me do care, I focus on who has shown me consistently that they care. For me at least, I was unconsciously repeating my childhood trauma. I would hurt myself as a child to gain connection and sympathy from my abusive mum. When it didn't work, I blamed myself and kept repeating these patterns with other people without realizing to prove to myself I was worthy in someone's eyes. Turns out that my mum was just uncaring, I can't make people be more caring, I just needed to surround myself with kinder people."

It’s not worth it to destroy yourself in the hope that people who wronged will feel bad for because they won’t. They won’t care.
Instead come back better and healthier as you were before. It’ll more annoy them more than to see that they still have the power over you and still can harm you throughout their simply existence. Show them that your above of them. It’ll also make you feel better and it’ll give you a hint of your power back."

I’m sorry you’re feeling like this. Your feelings are valid. My son had a GF in college that trashed him. He had also been suffering from depression and she used this to further destroy him by using him for $$ while belittling him to a shell. It’s a struggle I deal within myself not to make cement boots for her but really… I know it’s hard. Don’t allow her what she did because of her insecurities and selfishness to hurt you more and destroy your life. You’re better than that. You’ll be ok, I promise! Write her off as an evil person.

People don’t care who they hurt, they only care about themselves. Stop expecting anyone to ever care about you or your feelings, you’ll be much better off."

Feeling like a volcano about to explode ,"Hey everyone, i would like to start by saying that i’m usually the first person that people go and see when they feel sad and i can’t take it anymore. i’m not the type to get angry at all, i think the last time was when i was in preschool… anyway nowadays i have mixed feeling, i feel like an i have this ranging fire inside of me and one day i’m going to explode or i feel like i have to work harder then the rest to get the same results. 
I feel guilty, i have an amazing partner and a great job but something in my heart feels blocked. 
I hope someone can relate and hopefully i’m not the only one. ",M feeling crying I need to vent my pain

I feel so alone,"I live on my own with no family to support me, I might fail some of my courses which means I won’t be able to go back to school, and I can’t find a job. 
I got put onto academic probation and if I fail a course this year then they’ll put me on restriction. I don’t know what I’m going to do. I’d work but no one will fucking hire me. I’ve been looking for a job since March and honestly I don’t have any more hope. I’m so fucking done. If I fail, which I probably will because my depression is SO bad rn, and if I don’t find a job I think I might actually kill myself. I can’t do this anymore, I’m so stressed and tired and lonely. All I want to do right now is die. Maybe if I was born into a different family my life would be better.
Thanks mom, you ruined my life you useless tit. ",Why r uh depressed ..tell me I wanna listen to uh..
Random trauma dumping because no one else will listen to me,"
I lost my dad when I was 10. My mom couldn't deal with it and she became very unstable emotionally. She instructed me and my sister to never tell anyone that we had lost our dad because she felt scared to be living as a single mother with 2 young daughters who would soon be entering puberty. And she felt that if anyone knew about it they could hurt us in many ways. So me and my sister started lying about our dad at school, with friends, teachers, etc. Whenever kids would talk about their dads, I would become very uncomfortable and would try to avoid those conversations. I would also become very unsettled if someone asked me about my dad, even very casually in an everyday sort of way. But I learnt to lie and look chill about it too. 

Years later when I was around 18, I had a very bad breakup which destroyed me emotionally and did some things to my self respect. I vented to my best friend at the time. I also happened to divulge the bits about my dad. When she came to know about it, she became very angry about the fact that I had 'hidden' this from her. She also felt very annoyed that my ex knew about it and not her. The moment I told her about my dad, she turned the entire conversation to herself and expressed how much of a bad friend I was to have hidden that from her.

We had a bad fallout after that when I called her a 'cold fish' which offended her so much that she blocked me from everywhere. 

Before this fallout, I had often felt she had suspected there was something off about my family and dad. She would just send me father's day posts on random days (to check my reaction?) or ask me about his whereabouts but I never reacted or said anything. 

Anyway, we reunited after some years, things went okay for sometime, until she asked me one day - 'hope you don't mind me asking but why did your father abandon you guys?' 

No points for guessing that we have no connection now.
","I do this sometimes and I always hate myself afterwards. 

It's hard to keep it bottled up, it's a natural reaction to all that pain built up inside foe soo long. 

I know it's not great, but I promise you aren't alone ❤️"
I got fired today. ,"I just got fired from my new job. It's my 3rd or 4th week at this dentist office. I was so relieved and happy I was offered this job because it was exactly the job I've been looking for after having to quit my work study job because I lost my car.

This entire year, in general, has been absolute hell for me. I don't know what's going on anymore, but my suicidal thoughts are returning after being free from them for years. First, the year started off with me falling hard for someone I met and then experiencing my first traumatic heartbreak. My depression worsened, and I lost so much weight.

It's like this year has been a HUGE big and take for me. I was offered a work study job I was so excited for, then literally on the first day of my semester I lose my main source of transportation, have to take ubers/lyft, ended up in a rear end accident, had to quit my work study job and withdraw from my semester completely, was immediately offered the new dentist receptionist job, my sister let's me borrow her car to get to work everyday, things work out, but today I get fired. 

Im so fcking lost and confused. It was so sudden and blunt. I've never been fired from a job in my life. I'm a very soft-spoken person. And I only checked in patients. I didn't do anything serious since I'm still new. I welcomed the patients and made sure they were updated and kindly asked them to take a seat that they'd be called shortly. 

Today, the boss showed up. Was gone for the past two days. I haven't seen him since the first week I was there, but literally since the first day that I met him, I was getting bad gut feelings along with another woman who was there. Something was telling me that I was going to have trouble with them. 

I did not like that woman being nearby. Her vibe to me was just always off as well with the boss. I just would get feelings on my skin and guts that I was not going to enjoy working for them. 

Today, the boss called me back and straight up without wasting any time told me I was fired and that I did not need to say anything or justify myself. I kid you not. I was so dumbfounded. I legit thought he was about to say he was just joking. Like my mind was not processing what was going on.

He said that in the past two days he was gone, someone reported that I've had altercations with patients. Today and some other days. I literally haven't encountered one difficult patient since I started. And I've never argued with any patients in my life. All I have ever done since I started here is check patients in.

Im still so confused. And I started to think, have they mistaken me for someone else??? Just today, I literally WITNESSED an altercation with a hygienist and a patient. Could I have been mistaken for someone else?

He said this was all from word or mouth. The person who was in the room with him when he fired me was that same woman who had been giving me bad vibes since the first day. Mind you, me and this woman work on separate floors. I don't see her at all. 

The boss did not even let me say a word. He just told me straight up to leave. I couldn't defend myself. I'm still dumbfounded. I've never been fired from anywhere before. I've worked in a doctors office before, and I've never had negative experiences or been accused of an altercation or anything else. I've always been a soft-spoken person and try my best to work efficiently despite my mental health issues. 

I don't know what's going on. I don't know what this year was. im so confused with life lately. I feel like every day, I have less and less hope to keep moving forward with my life. I'm so broke, still don't have a car, and I have debt to pay off.

I literally got fired the day before Thanksgiving. What the fuck is going on. ","That is very unfortunate and confusing. I’m sorry that you were unexpectedly let go, but please understand that it obviously had nothing to do with you. Claim unemployment benefits, and tell the truth - that you did not knowingly go against any clinic policy and were fired without warning (no talk, no improvement plan).

I know how easy it is for these setbacks to feel like a crushing wave of stress that is not surmountable, but these problems are temporary. Suicide is not.

Please at least alert your family/friends how desperate you are feeling, and that you are stressed beyond your means and it is causing you to consider taking your own life. That may open doors for you if they know how desperate you are feeling. 

For now, claim unemployment if you can, use public transit, keep applying to jobs, and forgive yourself.

You’re obviously trying your best. That’s all you can ask of yourself, and worrying will not change the situation, so it’s okay to relax and focus on what you can do even one minute to the next."

Is it selfishness? Laziness? or is it depression? I feel that my life is a total waste. I just don't know why I'm still trying to be alive.,"Hello, I'm a 29F and I feel like I'm experiencing mild(?) depression for a few years now. I keep this red notebook where I write or draw horror stuff for story like an outlet just to put those dark thoughts into paper because there are days where I just want to end it. I sometimes find myself searching ways on how to do it silently. How did it come to this point?

During school years I really wanted to pursue art. The worst thing is the people who I thought would be my foundation of even just emotional support in a family, told me that ""What would you even earn in drawing? You need to study about something related to the industry."" And so I studied, graduated with a degree but did not pursue any work relating to it so in reality it's useless piece of paper. Imagine wasting 4 years in college. Worked in different companies for 8 years which drained me mentally. Tried medical field for a year, that didn't work too.

Funny thing is all those years, nothing of it was art related.

And few months ago, I lost my job because the company closed. Only a 2 weeks of notice, great.. savings being drained.. 

Now I committed myself in arts, I'm happy I can draw and make stories. But the opportunity for a career.. I'm back to zero there's a lot of competition and I feel like I'm already too late.

I'm here.. feels like life is just passing by.. to think it's almost December.",Before giving up you HAVE to try everything you can with your career. There's a lot of other companies that would like having you working there. Search for any kind of way to get out from this situation. If you are talented you will find a solution

If you want to try to work things out you can talk to her and mention your feelings were hurt but be prepared if that doesn’t go over well. As someone who has spent months and years chasing after friends who barely wanted me around sometimes the only thing you can do is work on letting them go in your own head. It doesn’t have to be a fight but you can work on reframing them as acquaintances instead of friends. Even if it’s hard try talking to new people. Be brave and ask people to coffee after class and stuff. Maybe try handing out more with friends you aren’t as close with. The world doesn’t end with one friendship even if it seems really painful at the time. There are people out there who would go out of their way to include you. There IS a difference when you make friends with people who value you and it does get better.

What should I do? Ask her about it? Ask another mutual about it? Just drop it? I'm lost. ",Ouch I felt that on such a personal level. I really hate that feeling. For me personally I learned I project my insecurities so I feel like it's worse cause I'm mentally making it worse for myself when it doesn't have to be. I'm boxing myself in. Its always easier to flake then to never even be invited. Also your in Uni so your young and there's tons of time still. Making friends older is much harder. (Me)
My best friend planned a friendsgiving and I'm not invited,"I heard about it from a mutual friend who assumed I was invited and asked me something about it. I don't know how to feel. Part of me assumes that it's just a giant misunderstanding, like I always think, but what is there to be misunderstood?

","I'd say citizens who grew up in the states have a much more passionate sense/serious feeling towards thanksgiving since it's what they grew up with most likely.  Akin, to Christmas.  Friendsgiving is mainly US citizens living abroad who wish to have the traditions of Thanksgiving and the holiday, mostly because they aren't able to be with family anymore, and also an eating and cooking holiday is usually well-received by everyone.  So Friendsgiving is just without family,  whether abroad or in the US.  It's usually taken quite lightly to non-US citizens cause they never grew up wtih it and generally have no idea what it's about.  Most of my friends who did not grow up in US or Canada were completely clueless and just tried to follow along.  Some brought donuts and chinese food, meanwhile the Americans organized Turkey, potatoes, traditional thanksgiving food which you can google nowadays.  

Yeah it's basically just a get together with some intent abroad.  An excuse to get together.  

If she's the only friend you have that doesn't mean you're the only friend she/her has so maybe this is one of the first time this has happened to you?  But this happens all the time in life, not getting invited etc.  You have fomo basically paired with anxiety of insecurity of why am I left out, which is an emotional response that over time you'll come to realize is a part of life that you'll get over or ignore as you become older and wiser."
Finding a good therapist is hard & one I can bond with too. Wish it was easier,"It is hard to find a good therapist that will help, they either say nothing or just refer me to someone else & end our sessions like my last one. I feel like I get more help from other people who suffer from depression & other mental illness. Today I had my second appointment with a new therapist, my second one this year, she is a nice lady & might genuinely want to help but the whole time again when I was saying what has happened & how I have been feeling she didn’t respond much, let alone say something supportive either, just asked if I would like to talk to someone else. I felt like what am I doing here. This has happened so much over the years. Sorry just wanted to vent to someone who might feel the same.",Hi friend. Certainly a sad experience in terms of therapy. Not sure what would lead them to send you off to someone else. I have had two therapists the first one didn’t work out as they were changing offices. I didn’t feel that I was connected well with them. On the other hand it’s based on what you tell them.
I have the noose ready,"My depression comes in hard and fast it feels like a sea of overwhelming emotion that I can’t deal with. I tried to help people to negate my own pain and feel better about myself but it just doesn’t seem to be enough anymore.

Also, maybe the reason why you are having difficulty with the last step is because you have a little hope that things can get better.

Why not take one last step in living?"

I don't feel valid,"I'm 14, I know I'm ""too young to feel the way I do"" (from my mom's own words) but I wanna kill myself, I have for as long as I can think back to when I was 5. I grew up with very mentally draining parents who emotionally abused me and treated me as a babysitter/maid, I was 8 and getting yelled at for things my baby sister did because they didn't want to watch their own kid and just sat on their asses doing nothing expecting me to do it all for them or because I tell asleep mid-day from being exhausted from being so mentally exhausted.I started self harming when I was 9 because I thought I deserved everything that's happened to me and I found the comfort in it, not long after it became an addiction and I'm extremely shameful to admit it but I also ended up getting addicted to m@sturbation(i was raped and sa as a child so I got exposed to things to things like porn at a young age) and my parents noticed I was always in my room just on my phone all day but they never cared to take me to a doctor until we finally got a new family doctor last year and they made me fill out one of those depression/anxiety papers. when my mom took the clip board out of my lap after I was down she started yelling at me because I wanted to kill myself as if it wasn't a shocker, they put me on anxiety meds and said I should probably go into therapy and when my mom told my dad the first thing he said was that I was the last person in the house to need either of those things(I've has to change my meds 5 times bc nothings working and my mom still hasn't looked into therapy). After that they started being a lot nicer to me and I'm not getting bullied anymore(just some friend issues ig) so I don't know why I still feel like this. I don't feel valid because when I sh the scars aren't visible because I'm scared to go any deeper nor do I feel valid because I still shower and make myself look nice for school but as soon as it's the weekend or break I can't seem to get myself to even brush my teeth or go out because all I can think about is how draining it sounds, same goes with showering or brushing my hair. but I feel like I'm just being lazy and that I'm not bad eough yet to be called ""depressed"". it's not like things in my life are going horrible right now, they can be better but I think everyone thinks "" things COULD be better"". I hate feeling this way because I know people have it worse than me rn, idk why but i want to get worse so badly. I want my parents to feel bad for all the things they did to me growing up

I know this is unnecessarily long and is all over the place so I'm just stopping here as it is. I don't think anyone's going to even read this so I had to get it off my chest. ","you’re not “too young” to feel the way you do, depression and anxiety have SUCH high rates for teenagers, there’s so many bad things that happen during those years and your brain isn’t anywhere near fully developed which makes it even harder for you to process those feelings. it will get better, i know it doesn’t seem like it right now and i know this may sound stupid to you but i promise you, it gets better as you get older and are able to be more independent. you have so much more to experience in life than just bad things, you got this. stay. live for all the wonderful things that will happen that will make you glad you stayed. i felt the same way when i was your age, im 20 now and i have a husband and we have cats together and life isn’t perfect and i still get sad but it’s so so much more bearable. it does get better, it takes a while but find things to live for, friends, animals, thoughts, experiences. find anything you can and cling onto it until it does get better"

Motivate me 😕,"If possible, 
can you motivate me to shower, wash my face, and brush my teeth in the mornings and not just at night? 
I have a good routine with flossing and brushing before bed but it’s so hard in the mornings…
I’m slowly falling into old habits of neglecting myself because I’m just.. tired. I hate the holidays and I am so stressed that I feel drained and my skin is breaking out. I have no motivation to do anything but eat, sleep, use the bathroom, and lay in my bed watching YouTube. I don’t want it to get bad again but I’m almost feeling like I couldn’t care less… 😕 hopefully Christmas isn’t bad, but it’s usually worse. 
Honestly anything. Facts about not showering, anything? 
I also have ADHD on top of this so the procrastination and lack of motivation work together against my anxiety which makes me feel I need to constantly be productive which also drains me as i constantly need the toilet. ","maybe try playing a rly upbeat song you like and pretend ur some random character - I have a hard time rushing my teeth and some times all i do is mouth wash

I think getting over the idea that brushing ur teeth HAS to be all or nothing (floss brush 2 min mouthwash) and just being like - anything i manage to do counts (toothpaste only, scrubbed the toothbrush with no tooth paste, just mouth wash, etc) helped me just start creating that habit.

watching tiktoks too about skincare helped me get excited -I treated it like a fun activity rather than a chore I HAD to do - but something that was nice that I enjoyed - playing fun music or any music to get you into a mood helps me."

I feel like i have nothing to do and nothing to look forward to. I constantly think of how I would go about offing myself. What would I write on a note before I go. Who would I mention and who would I apologize to. I have yet to get therapy, although I did contact a therapist and have an appointment set up, he’s not available for a month and a half. Earlier today i was thinking what if I die before my first ever appointment. The weirdest thing about all of this is that I have no intention of suicide, but when I think of it I feel terrible—and I think about it often. I can’t keep going like this, I feel so tired everyday even though I don’t have much physical activity anymore. I live with a constant sinking feeling in my stomach.

Is there any hope for me? ,"I feel like my whole life is just collapsing rapidly. My relationship of 12 years just ended, I have barely any family, virtually no close friends or strong community, and I quit my career in tech almost a year ago because I needed a break from the burnout. I just turned 40 and feel like life has passed me by in so many ways and it’s too late to change things. I’m doing okay financially for now and living fairly comfortably but I feel hopeless, lonely, meaningless, so unimportant, and wishing I could have done more or been more or made some type of difference in the world. 

I don’t know why I’m posting this here but if anyone has suggestions I would appreciate. I am going to therapy but I need to change my life, find purpose and meaning, or somehow get myself out of this.

Am I just cursed to be like this?,"In spite of my comically severe ADHD, my current depressive episode, and other more minor issues, I thought enough to come to some sort of conclusion about myself and others. Some people, like me, operate on a ""Why do anything? Why be happy?"" basis, and others the exact opposite -- ""Why do nothing? Why be sad?"".

I've tried changing my mindset over and over but nothing ever seems to work. There's never an answer thats ""good enough"" to motivate me to do anything for more than a little bit, and there's never a ""good enough"" reason for me to be happy. Even when there seems to be, even when logically I should be able to just get out of bed and do stuff for once and function like a normal human being, theres just some part of me that physically doesnt let me get up. Its like I lack the brain cells to fire my muscles to proceed with the action, I guess thats just executive dysfunction.

I don't even have enough energy to seek professional help, what the fuck am I even supposed to do? Am I just cursed to be unhappy for my whole life? I feel like killing myself is the only real answer and I'm too scared to do that, because I'm scared of nothingness after death, but due to my beliefs, I think thats almost certain.

am i just pretending ,"I am a 17 year old girl, and i would say since eighth grade i’ve felt depressed. My arm is littered in scars and so are my thighs but no one knows that as i hide my legs. I have 5 siblings and growing up was rough, my parents constantly fought and we struggled financially. We still do, growing up i don’t remember a lot of my childhood the only things i do remember are the bad parts of it when really traumatic things happened. Like when my brother tried to burn our house down with me, my mother, father, grandma, aunt, and cousin inside. My brother is a diagnosed schizophrenic and he is bipolar he only recently began taking medicine for it because he was trying to kill my dad for something he did in the past which was very terrible but was so traumatic i can’t share. None of my other siblings witnessed it but me, and my mother and father left me during the incident. 

I was maybe 9 at the time. Another thing u can remember vividly is my sixth birthday, my father was cheating on my mother and took all the money for my bday to spend on his mistress. My mom found out and we spent my sixth bday walking up and down the street with a bat. When i was 12 i had a fish and my parents were arguing at the time, I didn’t listen to my mom and I hadn’t put my fish in his tank yet as we just got him a day or two ago. My father was so mad at my mom he took my fish and threw him at the wall he died instantly, and I had to bury him the next day. My father knew he was my fish and still did it, i don’t know why. I think about that a lot and he refuses that it happened if i bring it up. On my 15th bday my parents were once again fighting and my father was so mad at my mom him took all the money from their shared bank account, so we couldn’t do anything that day and he also didn’t speak to
me the entire day not even a happy birthday. 

Another birthday of mine my parents were fighting and my dad punched the stove, it was one of those old glass ones and he shattered it. We spent my birthday eating ham sandwiches and with no cake. Those are just a few I can recall at this moment, to me those don’t sound that bad as that has always been my life. I’ve never really had friends and got bullied through most of my years of school, it’s left me feeling disconnected and as if something is wrong with me. I try to speak about it with my parents but they work full time and by time they get home they are too tired to interact with me. I’m the last of my siblings at home so it’s very quiet and lonely here, i just go to work and back and i do ask my parents to go places but again they are very tired and don’t have much energy when it comes to me. 

Even just talking my parents don’t pay much attention to me, they tend to kind of just nod their head and ignore what I say. I’ve tried to communicate this issue but they just it’s not true. Actually in 5th grade I had my first concert my parents told me they were going to come and they did not, instead they went shopping with my sister and the whole concert i was looking for them. I had to wait an extra 2 hours with my band teacher until my parents finally came to pick me up, when I was visibly upset all my mom could’ve said was “i got you popsicles!” that tends to be common, when i have a breakdown or shut down my mom just buys me food to try and make up for it when all i want is for her to tell me i love you. I hate saying that and get uncomfortable when anyone says it to me even my parents, i don’t really know why and tend to hate relationships and i only ever want ppl who are bad for me but that’s another thing. I got put in therapy my freshmen year of hs, and i am now a junior. 

My therapist has said i’ve only gotten worse and wants me to take antidepressants as she diagnosed me with anxiety and clinical depression, my mom thinks that’s diagnose is fake and it’s not true. Today I got into a fight with my sister and it was because she doesn’t work and my parents take my money, to give to her so she can keep living in college. My parents never pay me back, and i wouldn’t mind lending them money but they never give it back. I save my money and i never get to even spend it on me. I was just joking when my sister went off on me, and so i obviously went off too which was wrong of me it only escalated the problem. My sister called me a bitch, selfish, and rude. She says i only stress our mother out and that im faking all of this for attention, she said “if you want to die so bad do it, i hate you so much you stupid bitch. and your stupid ass arm because you want to fake cut yourself.” 

She also stated I have no reason to feel like this, and yea i feel like she’s right I wish I could explain why I feel like this but I can’t. 

I have huge keloids all over my arm because I’m a cutter. I don’t like to show them and mainly wear long sleeves because of this, that really hurt me and broke my heart because I was so happy for my sister to come back from college, and when she said i just stress my mom out and that i’m faking it made me think if my mom feels that way too. And i asked my mom to tell me the truth if she really does feel like that and she kept avoiding it, leading that she probably does. I hate feeling like this everyday and i wish so bad that didn’t and everyone says i’m rude but i don’t mean too. I just hate myself and i dont know what to do either. I wish i could wake up happy and just stay happy, but i can’t and i don’t know why. Now i probably will stop talking, when I have a problem or a pain i think I’ll just keep it to myself for the sake of everyone. 

I don’t want to be a bother and I just thought my mom cared, i thought she believed me. But from what my sister said i guess she’s just over me. Am i just faking this? Do i really just want attention ? because i hate feeling like this everyday, everyone says im so rude but its because i hate myself everyday. I just wish I could disappear and she’s right i’m just a stress for everyone. ","It sounds like you are living in a very distressing and unhealthy environment at home. I don’t think you are faking the way you are feeling at all. Just remember that you are still very young, and that you have so much ahead of you in life. Are you planning on moving out or going to college when you are 18? I would definitely recommend that you try to get out of that hostile environment. I’m very sorry to hear about your fish too by the way. I just lost my dog after 11 years, and I know how hard it can be to lose a pet."

I’m a failure.,"I’m a 22yr old man who’s currently lost in life and very depressed. I’m in college, but i transferred schools after my sophomore year and i haven’t stuck with a degree longer than a year. this means i really don’t have much direction in terms of what degree i should get, and any degree will take an extra 2+ years to earn. my parents are helping with my college, and every day i beat myself up about the fact they’ve spent their time and money into my college education and i’ve been unsuccessful in graduating in 4yrs. all 3 of my siblings have graduated and much more respectable universities. to add insult to injury, i’m currently failing all of my classes this semester, with not much time left. i reached out to all my professors, explaining my situation and that i know there may not be much they can do, but if i could do anything to help my chances of passing, only 2 responded and one of those was a no. my parents firmly believe i will not go back to college if take time off, and they think im closer to a degree than i actually am. i dont want to drop out it’s the last thing i want, and my parents do have a say if they have helped my college career financially. 

i sit in my bed tonight back home with my family and i don’t know if i can take feeling like this much longer. ive been numb pretty constantly for the last 3 years of my life. my college town has very few therapist, and the majority of them are family and couple oriented. to me. online therapy hasn’t been great for me. 

i just want to feel normal again. i want to make my parents proud, and i want to get my life ","You're not a failure; you're going through a tough time, and it's okay to seek support and take things one step at a time"
Is there a good reason to keep living?,"17M. I’m depressed, upset, and angry. I want to keep living, but i need a reason too. I’m in a tough spot, and I need a reason to reduce the stress I have on me.","Here is one of the best reasons and what makes it so is that it is fact  and does not require anything but you simply exsisting. (By the way sorry for my gramatical errors but its super hard for me to remember to go back and correct them when i am finished, and if i dont get my thought out quick im gonna get distracted)
 So yes the world does seem to suck latley,  im not going to start listing why, we can fill in the blank with something. But what people keep forgetting is that  your very exsistance and the way the energy that came together came together and made you, out everything it could of been, is freaking awesomness. The chances of it ever happening again are like well over 1 in a gajillion. If thats even a number.  Even our brightest scientist havent been able to figure out the universes energy and how it knows where to go and what to do. We know how are physical bodies are formed but thats it. We know energy does not disappear but where does it go when it leaves and how did it know to go here.  You my friend are nothing short of a miricle and that is not an exageration. Some part of you even if you cant access it now, wants to be here and did everything it could to be you dont you think you at least owe it the opertunity to figure out what that was. 
Plus there are so many things in life we dont see until we see it, its a grest adventure i promise its well worth it. Plus im pretty sure our soles dont give up just because we do,  they just do it again."

Is this college?,"Lately, I(20F) have been unmotivated. I don't think I am depressed either. My univ or maybe I don't get along with my classmates since last semester after they stole money worth 100usd and my bank passbook. I let it pass actually because what if they really needed that money but I was mad. Then there was the time where they lowkey bullied me because of my status (I am not wealthy tho they picked on me for ""being"" one). During lunch time, when we went to the cafeteria, some of them said I was stingy for not buying them lunch and said some sort of things. I usually saw this on the movies and didnt think i'd be the one experiencing it. Growing up, I wasnt bullied or the bully. I am average. My last straw of them was them raiding my bag for some shit trend called bag raid but wasnt informed they ""raided"" my wallet and stole 10 dollars. 

I rarely get angry but I am boiling inside, I don't want to report them too because that will tamper their records but I can't take it anymore. I can't just cry and do nothing. I don't even have someone to talk too. It's just shitty. I wanted to tell my parents I wanted to transfer but don't have the heart to do so. It's not just ruining something in me but it is also ruining my academic life.

At first I was impressed by them being intelligent in class because I could never do that. I am pretty much average but them? They are the highest point of intelligent, thats why I look up to them. I wanted to be intelligent too but how come they are bullies? ",Nothing wrong with you. You are are a really nice person. Don't be afraid to stick up for yourself.

People can be not so nice sometimes I've been on both ends of bullying and it's much more common than we expect it to be before getting into uni or high schools. But you can find someone who resonates with you or someone who is not amongst the bullies.I hope you find someone if not just bear with it until you get out of there or find friends elsewhere. Also you could bully the bullies and become a bully bully like I did it's fun actually takes time though what I did was luck then one by one and threaten them physically when they are alone or just try to make friends with ones who aren't bad people but are in just bad influence. Basically I dealt with them individually one by one and I wasn't bullied anymore and actually bullied some of them weak bullies which was fun ngl.

Very immature behavior on their part and they are definitely bullies. 

Theft is a crime. Pure and simple. Maybe they need their records tarnished to teach them a lesson. They will continue to take advantage of you as long as they can. Being intelligent and book smart doesn’t make someone a good human being. I’d rather have a considerate average friend than a smart, unkind one.

This is obviously affecting your mental health and studies. Perhaps you should consider talking to your parents about transferring. Either that or stand up to them or report them. In my opinion, this isn’t a normal college experience. Not how I remember it. You deserve a better college life than this."

If I wake up after 12, I literally grab a snack and get right back in bed cause I don’t see the point of even trying to get anything done before the sun sets. It’s a silly mindset I know.

It feels so silly to be giving you a word of advice when I’m in the same way, but take baby steps. Maybe next time you get up to eat, sit somewhere else to eat, try and get cozy in another place than your bed. As the smallest little step. Then maybe you can slowly build up to going out to eat somewhere (of course going out to eat every day isn’t sustainable, but just to make an example of a goal you could keep in this specific lane if trying to change everything at once is overwhelming)"

Not the healthiest. Cause then you’re not getting blood pressure up. You’re prolly not eating enough or drinking enough water (which I’m a hypocrite to say) but like it could be worse by minuscule only cause of how bad it already it is. 

My suggestion: every day, try to be up for one 
More hour than you were the day before. And it’s okay to relapse. It’s okay if you need stick to a certain amount of hours. But just focus on trying to get yourself moving more every day. Find something to do every day. Whether it’s watching tv on the couch. Playing games on the computer. Giving a phone call to someone. Just do ANYTHING that gets you out of bed and is normal human basic functioning. 

Secondly: if possible. Please try to get outside at least once a day for at least 5 minutes the sun will help you wake you up and make you feel more energized. 

Lastly: don’t feel scared to ask for help. Have a friend come by and hang out for a bit. So you’re out of your room and doing something fun. Or just have someone call you to make sure you ate all your meals. Or talk about something fun you did. It’s not easy asking for help. But it does wonders. ESP When you ask the right people. 

I hope this helps. I’m happy to talk more and give more suggestions."

Yes, it's dangerous: you don't have to scale this up by much before you can't move. Yeah, that can happen with depression. 

Also remember that recovering from what you're going through is where suicide attempts happen, because hooray now that I'm getting better I have the executive function capability to go through with an attempt. 

The big warnings out of the way, a sedentary lifestyle generally has poorer outcomes because in a case like this there's less hydration and nutrition overall in addition to a lack of exercise. 

And let me tell you, the atrophy can make getting out of depression harder because with not being so depressed as to be in bed all day comes not being in bed all day which generally means more physical activity."

Lying in bed is VERY unhealthy for your body. In the hospital, they say every day you are in a hospital bed, it takes 3 days to recover. In2018, I spent 6 mths in the hospital. Trust me, you want to keep up your stamina if you can help it. 
It's extremely challenging to build back your strength once you lose it. 
I'm still on an IV 20 hrs a day at home, but unless I'm having a flare-up or utterly exhausted from doing too much, then I'm up and active doing dishes, putting in laundry, doing a puzzle.

Sometimes you have to just suck it up. Do the thing…what sucks is most all our hold up is in our own minds. It’s tough"
23 hours is how much time I’ve spent in my bedroom for the past month. How bad is it for my health?,I live alone and spend about one hour between meals/showering. I take meds for depression and been to therapy. I know I will get better at one point but genuinely curious to know if staying in bed for 23 hours of my day is bad for my body. Also if anyone has been in the same situation how did you get out of this cycle? I don’t have friends or family and currently unemployed so no one really knows I’m going thru this. Thank you for your time. ,"Try pretending/imagining that you are your own child or pet. And you’re trying to heal your child/pet. Strongly encourage yourself to get out of bed and move around. Stay hydrated, eat well, get some sunshine and fresh air. All the basics. Start small but try to keep a schedule. Sometimes it helps to get out of the first person mindset and realize you wouldn’t let a small child you were caring for languish in bed. You would do things to make them healthy and happy.  Good luck, I’ve definitely been there.  One more thing… Maybe try yoga. Yoga with Adrienne on YouTube is nice. You could do a lazy 20 min session just to move around and she is very positive and cute so. It’s nice. She got me out of a rut once. My first goal was merely to lay on the mat and play the video. Eventually I was actually doing yoga everyday. It was good for my mind even more than my body."

Why,"I'm lonely, I'm depressed, I'm society anxious. I ask for help but I don't get it. WHY? Maybe I dont fucking deserve it","What you don't deserve is to feel like this. you do deserve help, you do deserve to feel ok. It's not fair that you feel like shit. I have these same problems and something that helped me was deciding to give a stranger a compliment every day. We are hardwired deep down to get good feelings from doing pro social things like that. It makes me feel less lonely without having to talk about me"
Why,"I'm lonely, I'm depressed, I'm society anxious. I ask for help but I don't get it. WHY? Maybe I dont fucking deserve it","For starters I'm gonna say relatable. Secondly join the club, idk how old you are but me at the ripe old age of 21 am already fed up with life. Being successful and happy just does not interest me because no matter how hard I try nothing changes. Especially during this ""the magic you want is in the work you aren't putting in"" bullshit generation lol. It's all bullshit, you either have it or you don't and I certainly do not have it. I am off to Sweden to get myself euthanized as soon as I can afford. Continue looking for happiness and prosperity in this shit hole we call home and I guarantee you it will only get worse haha. Happy hunting."
Why,"I'm lonely, I'm depressed, I'm society anxious. I ask for help but I don't get it. WHY? Maybe I dont fucking deserve it",I want to do the same I can't stand my life every part of it was shit and now I'm so messed up mentally I couldn't work if I really wanted to just the idea of trying to get a job as an EMT or EMS whichever which is something I've always wanted to do. But just being around people I don't know makes me panic and if I'm in a crowd I just go full meltdown
"Turning 33 soon, broken and alone","Hi, I'm dealing with a situation that is slowly destroying me, therapy isn't doing much, hope for advices at least is free.  

I grew up with a shitty mom and my friends eventually became my family.
I was happy, never had love interests but I felt so much loved anyway.  
But by 30 it all changed. Some friends moved away for work, others just stopped making time, many had kids and only hung out with other couples w kids.  
I missed them so much that I slowly fell into depression. Some pushed me to ""get a girl"" and that just brought anxiety.  
My best friend used to help me in the past two years, but now she's starting a difficult pregnancy so we can't be in touch.  
She likely alarmed the others. Sometimes I recieve kind texts or audios asking how I'm doing, but it feels more like a mandatory check because they often ignore my replies. I don't want their pity, I just want to hang out and maybe grab a pizza.  
I've been through so much shit as a child and I did my best for everyone I knew, but feels like it meant nothing to them.  

In two weeks it's my birthday and nobody will be there. It's worsening, I'm having panic attacks.  
I've been in therapy for over 2y and now even going there is stressful. My current treatment includes bromazepam+amoxapine, but it feels more like a full body sedation except for where it hurts the most.
I'm so scared and hurt and alone, how to deal with this?",I will be happy to go for a pizza with you don’t have to date I’m older than you. Just company someone to talk with I’m very depressed to
Sad,I wish my heart didn’t go to my stomach every time I think about him and what he could be doing without me. I wish I could just move on. It’s so fucking hard. ,"I've had this feeling for three people and for me it just got worse and worse with each person. What helped me the most was to write in a journal - something private or in my phone that i can hide from my family and friends. I';; just spam write anything and everything when I'm sad- even if i said it in that last sentence or sometimes i've make it artistic like a poem...

Ill add a date to everything I write and when i'm down i'll sometimes read through my posts and find times where I was happy or uplifting - and it's kind of a reminder to be strong from myself - even if i get sad the next day. eventually my daily journals (or even hourly) got more and more positive as i read through past positive or insightful journal entries.

It took me months and months of this- and will definitely not get rid of the sad completely- but it helped me feel more self assured and confident in being by myself- I kind of became my own friend.

I still get sad when I think about them sometimes and what could of happened if it all worked out but Im now able to remind myself more clearly all the reasons it wouldn't work out- and how there are better people for me.

i guess the diary entries mostly helped with getting those spiraling thoughts out of my head quicker and helped me refocus on something more beneficial."
Sad,I wish my heart didn’t go to my stomach every time I think about him and what he could be doing without me. I wish I could just move on. It’s so fucking hard. ,There's not really any advice I can give. I don't know how love feels. Im sorry.

It’s so fucking hard. ,"I’ve been thinking about journaling. I have written a couple of poems. It’s hard for me bc it’s my husband and we have children, so I have to see him often. It starts over every time I see him. Sadly"
Sad,I wish my heart didn’t go to my stomach every time I think about him and what he could be doing without me. I wish I could just move on. It’s so fucking hard. ,"I'm so sorry, that sounds really difficult. I remember when I was young, my mom had divorced my father a few months back, and she would cry in the living room./ when we were asleep. She did her best to stay strong when we were awake and would hide it. I was soo scared to go comfort her but I had wished I did. We weren't close then so I didn't' know what to do.. 

  
Journaling and maybe getting excited for your own future could help - like a desire board or just dreams that you may have forgotten - just anything that you can envision for yourself in the future. 

I hope you start feeling stronger soon <3"
Sad,I wish my heart didn’t go to my stomach every time I think about him and what he could be doing without me. I wish I could just move on. It’s so fucking hard. ,Thank you. It’s been very difficult. I have great days and of course bad days. I’ve been reading The Secret and it’s helping me to start thinking positively and love myself again.

",Yeah and the only way to do that unfortunately is to just do it and do it often. I don’t know if anyone isn’t born with that but I was and I overcame it for the most part.

I just want to die. ","What I learned with age about depression, is that it doesn't really matter if someone sees you or ignores you. My first time was at 11, and it got worse and worse, I really sought help and I was the strongest person I could, but over the years I understood that you don't have to be strong, that you can cry and that's a gift. 
My advice is; you lack one thing to do and you should try it, you know you lack to be you, the real one, to cry without fear, to talk to your friends at heart, to tell them your experiences and your circumstances, maybe you are afraid? But what are you afraid of, to lose them? Look at you, you're shattered and lost, then try to find you, try to be real
That person w fear and pain in his heart, that person that they doesn't know about
Just relax and let tears and fear frow away."

I’m trying to find a solution for my cat so someone will take care of him just like I try to do, the only thing I more or less did properly… 

The only thing I kept doing and now I’m so down in my depression that I can see how I’m not being as careful as I was before towards him and I can’t do this to him. 


I can’t offer him the best if he stays with me so I have to find someone who will give everything I can’t give him anymore. 



I can’t say that to my friends because they see me as the strong one who can overcome everything and if I tell them how I feel, they won’t believe me and they will say “oh don’t worry it’ll be fine you’re always fine” 



I just want to die. ",Do you have a wife and kids? Do you stay by yourself? Do you have your own house?
I might unalive myself today,"I’ve been trying so hard for the past decade, I did everything I could do to be better for me, I tried to do yoga, therapy, travel, work, love life… I tried food, alcohol, self care… you name it. 


I’m turning 30yo in two months and I’m done with life.

I just want to die. ",I have/had all of those.   Multiple times.  All failures.   I know I’m the common denominator but I really have tried my best to correct my original behaviors and mistakes.   But those corrections all failed as well and now my physical health is failing to go with the serious mental health issues I’ve had for 3 decades.  I have no energy left to continue
"I can't create, too inferior","Hi, I've been trying to do stuff lately, I like to draw and sometimes I like to think that it's what I do best, I have a ton of ideas that've always had just sitting there, problem is that whenever I try to illustrate them, I end up hating everything about me; my skill, my ideas, my body and in general just myself, then I feel like I'll never make something decent or acceptable, that I'm too stupid to achieve what I want, i just fucking hate myself

I just want to stop thinking and lie in bed, I want to forget I'm myself, sorry if it seems like just rambling, I suck at this","I understand how you feel, I was an idiot and quit drawing because of those feelings. But don't be like me, because later on you'll look at your drawings and think ""these are much better than I remembered. Why did I quit? I would be so good at drawing now if I hadn't quit"". Breathe. Draw that feeling. Put the hate on paper, just as bad as it feels. Use that energy you have in your body, it has to go somewhere, right? Use it on your art. It doesn't have to look good, it just has to come out. Maybe then you'll reach more forgiving mindset to work towards your goals? Might even find a nice technique by accident. Drawing is a process and dealing with feelings is a process too, so maybe you could mix those things up a little? Just a suggestion, but give it a thought. Don't give up!"

To avoid the psych hospital it's necessary to make it clear to them that you're not in current danger. But if you truly are in danger and you're worried you're going to do something when you get out, it might be necessary unfortunately.

But if not, tell her your having passive suicidal thoughts. Make it clear that you won't do anything to yourself but those thoughts are there but you're stressed out and need someone to talk to for comfort.

Usually they determine if you need to go with a psych evaluation. That's especially where you want to make it clear it's not active and you aren't actually in danger.

"I'm in the hospital and have suicidal thoughts, how do I ask for help?","I'm in the hospital for chest pain, result came out normal, it's obvious that it's anxiety. But now I'm having suicidal thoughts, I don't know how to ask for help cause I don't want to be exaggerating and don't want to stay in psych ward",why don't you want to stay in the psych ward?

"I'm in the hospital and have suicidal thoughts, how do I ask for help?","I'm in the hospital for chest pain, result came out normal, it's obvious that it's anxiety. But now I'm having suicidal thoughts, I don't know how to ask for help cause I don't want to be exaggerating and don't want to stay in psych ward","Thank you everyone for the kind response, it makes me know that there's someone I can ask for help. Depression just makes me incapable of helping myself but not towards others. I was shocked at how many people could see the suffering on my face throughout my time in the hospital. After I calm down and become myself again they said ""I'm glad you look really glowing today"" I ask help with strangers on the internet because I keep thinking that I might burden people and saw their facial expressions and intonation and got hurt by it. 
Thankfully I have calm myself down by crying on the floor beside my hospital bed for some times, before that I was pacing around and wandering on how to kill myself (I'm always like this after I met with my psychologist and psychiatrist or if I'm triggered), doctor have ruled that my chest pain is not because heart or lung problems. I met 3 psychiatrists for 2 days. They prescribed me new medication since my old one seems not working, surprisingly I swallow the medication. Apparently I was super stressed at home, because my heart rate that was always above 100 at home is now 87 or 90 here at the hospital, so my sister and the doctor decided to make me stay in the hospital for a while, for now I'm still in the medical ward. For the reason of me being stubborn to take medication I have many reasons that I come up as to why I was refusing to even take it. FYI I want to take my medication but it was too hard and too emotional for me and it's draining me at the thought that I have to take it everyday and it might not even work, so I didn't take it. 95% of myself refuse to help myself and only 5% of myself is trying. Everyday I battle with my mind saying ""please lets just give up stop struggling to survive, please 5% cooperate with us and let's just die"" and another part is like ""how can I take my medication, why do I refuse so badly on taking my medication, let's try meeting another professional, keep meeting with a professional, what can I do"""

Only thing that got me out of that cycle cuz I kept going back and getting worse was going to this very supportive rehab place that actually treated me like a human and didn't ignore me.

Not saying all psych wards will do that and if it's really bad it might be necessary but yeah I can get why some people don't want to go."

he said he is stubborn so he doesn't take them in the first place and we don't know, WE DON'T KNOW, what's behind that approach to medication. we oversimplify on posts. he is not gonna share with us his life story, is he?

and even if there was nothing more than him being stubborn he is in the middle of a fucking crisis.

now, i don't know about you but, if i'm considering to attempt or harm himself on the same hospital with, I don't know, scissors (as he said in other comments), maybe, just maybe, being called stupid may trigger something.

but! i don't know! i have been lucky enough to have been looked after with compassion and care on my suicidal crisis. and i have no doubt that if, on those crucial moments, i said i was avoiding meds (which i wasn't. i was in fact with a lot of antidepressants), the good people that had my back would never. ever. insult me.

it's not about what resonates with you. and your sense of who deserves or not your sympathy. if you can't offer comfort to a person in danger of themselves then don't intervene. don't insult. it's not helpful at all.

it's not that difficult to understand."

The truth is I’ve been in a very dark place not only cause I lost someone, but because I just don’t feel like myself anymore.
