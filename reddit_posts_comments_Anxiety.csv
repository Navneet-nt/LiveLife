Elections and Politics,"Hello friends!

It's that time of the year again. We have always intended for r/Anxiety  to be a safe, politically neutral space for users, and we wish to keep it that way. We will be removing and locking threads that go out of hand with the political aspects of things.

Political anxiety is more common than you think around election time. If you are having trouble with political anxiety, there are ways to cope with the stress. Here are a few examples:

**Timeout**: Social media, including the news channels, are designed to have a negative tilt to collect views. They want you to keep coming back for more. It is an excellent idea to differentiate between thoughtful and stress-inducing, sensationalized material. It is okay to find out about news after it breaks. By waiting for accurate information and thoughtful analyses, you will be able to provide informative content for yourself. Limiting the use of social media to once or twice a day will be beneficial. If your political anxiety is still too much to handle, it might be time to take an extended break.

**Control**: The majority of what is happening in national and global politics is out of our personal control. Turning our attention to ourselves, our friends, families, and local communities can help us be empowered and productive. Engaging in activities you enjoy, such as hobbies, exercise, and time with friends, can be a healthy distraction. Practicing self-care through wellness techniques and programs can also help keep your anxiety in check. Here are some websites that provide helpful information and tips on self-care:

[El Camino Health: Emotional Self Care](https://www.elcaminohealth.org/community/chinese-health-initiative/specialty-programs/emotional-well-being/emotional-self-care)

**Community**: Connect with individuals who provide a safe space for understanding current events. Sharing what you are thinking and feeling with trusted peers can mitigate the negative effects of stress.

**Engage**: The feeling of helplessness can be stressful and discouraging. Getting involved with a local political party, volunteering with a community group, or participating in activism can help you feel a sense of accomplishment, power, and purpose. These activities also connect communities of like-minded people, which helps to alleviate stress.

I do have disc bulge that are minor so leg pain is understandable. Whenever i go to a doctor they laugh it out that it's not possible. My family is now treating me as someone crazy and constantly blaming me that I've ruined their lives with my daily hospital spendings and daily panic attacks"

My bloodwork appears to be normal and my abdominal ultrasound is normal as well. Can't help, but go down the rabbit hole of ""what ifs"" . Hoping this is just my anxiety acting up and that everything goes back to normal soon."

I’m not depressed but i can’t help but think i’m better off dead,"No i won’t kill myself. I’m just saying when i sit back and think about it i think i really am, life is full of stuff to cope with for me and i just don’t understand why life can’t be as simple for me as it is for others it seems. ","Depression doesn't have to be so bad that it causes s thoughts. It can be quite ""mid"", sometimes it's called ""high functioning"". When you are quite an active person, not even that much sad all the time, but there is still this constant feeling like there's no real purpose for anything in life."

I don't want advice as i've tried almost everything there is, i just want to exist without the insufferable sickening thoughts and emotions even if that means stripping myself off my humanity. 

Please just answer the question above! thank you. ❤️",what did you say to get it prescribed
"Why do so many drs prescribe Buspirone ""as needed""","I'm on Lexapro which works great for my ocd and GAD but I've been going though a lot of stress at work lately and my doctor prescribed me buspirone and told me to take it when I ""needed to take the edge of"" or every day if I found it helpful.

I know many people say strongly that it takes weeks to build up and it has no place as an as needed anxiety med. But if that's the case why are thousands of doctors prescribing it as needed? 

Please don't just post ""your doctor is wrong!"" I'm looking for an actual answer on why so many doctors want us to take it as needed.

Thanks!","I don’t get this either. My understanding is buspirone is meant to treat chronic/on-going anxiety, and you have to take it daily, and it takes time to build and for your body to adapt to it. When people say their doctors say to take buspar on an as needed basis, it makes me wonder if the doctor is actually thinking of fast acting/shorter time scale meds like hydroxyzine or benzos."

Some good suggestions here, but please don't feel you need to just start taking something for it. People mean well, but everyone is going to recommend something you can 'take' for it, but is not always the solution. (general gut care is extremely important though.. Keep it healthy, it'll help)

But yes, 25 year veteran here.. I assure you, you can heal. I'm having the hardest year of my journey. And that's saying a lot.. But I'm as resilient as ever, and the gut has been a huge issue.

Ginger is also great, I loath the taste but drinking tea or eating like ginger chews has become sort of self-soothing ritual for me, if I get queasy or my stomach starts to cramp I'll sit down and eat one of those and taking myself out of an anxious situation Plus physically doing something that helps me feel better has made the anxiety around my stomach issues a lot less bad."

Has anyone found anything that has helped? ","I found a combination of using psyllium fiber caplets (Metamucil) because it helps bulk up your stool making it more solid and probiotics (I used Florostor) and it helped balance things. Word about probiotics, read the ingredients some brands use things in them that can trigger diarrhea such as chicory root or Jerusalem artichoke. Especially if you possibly have undiagnosed IBS, it can be terrible. 

In the short term use Imodium but also make sure you drink a lot of water with it because the resulting constipation can be just as bad as the diarrhea. 

I hope this helps you in some way!"

","Synthetic THC can have this effect on because it is a lot more potent than natural THC, which can cause hallucinations, agitation, rapid heart rate, vomiting, and psychosis. Just from my own experience, I know how you are feeling and the anxiety that can come after an experience like this. What I can see from the context you gave, this experience may have impacted how anxiety symptoms are manifested. I can’t say for sure, but because it was a significant experience that seems to be tough to move past, it has significance to how you are feeling every day. Mind and body are very connected, it could be from the gummy because taking substances that make you feel similar to how you felt on synthetic THC might trigger a similar physical response (Because your anxiety is preventing you from experiencing that feeling again, idk how to explain it but I hope this made some sense)."

"Tripped on an edible 4 months ago, now I have recurring anxiety attacks.","About 4 months ago, maybe a little longer? I had a synthetic THC gummy and absolutely tripped tf out. Felt like I was dying. Vomiting, hallucinations, couldn’t see or talk. I was also out cold for the next 2-3 days and after I came to I had the worst feeling of impending doom.

Well, earlier this afternoon I took Pamprin for menstrual pain. I didn’t realize it had drowsy antihistamines in it. I started to have another attack and it just now subsided. 

Is this because of the gummy I ate? Did it just awaken my anxiety?? It’s the worst thing i’ve ever experienced and it keeps happening. ","So when I was in my teens I took some knife hits and I had a severe panic attack once the weed hit.... I know it's not a gummy but same concept... After about 20 minutes I was staring at a window and I was rubbing my jaw and my whole entire site went red and I felt like my tongue was falling out of my mouth. A complete lucid hallucination that I knew I was in but I couldn't get out of and it lasted for hours. I was out for about 2 or 3 days... After that I've had panic attacks my whole life. They come and go here and there but I think something like that just awakens the anxiety part of your brain, This is only your brain trying to protect itself because of what happened. Almost like a trauma response from what I have been told from my therapist. Doesn't mean that's what's happening to you or anything like that I'm not a doctor or a therapist so I cannot say for sure. But it sounds very similar. I would absolutely stray away from doing it again practice mindfulness, getting out in nature breathing exercises they absolutely do work if you stick with them. Just know your brain is very complex, It will do things and make you feel things that feel absolutely horrendous. Doesn't mean that you're going crazy or anything's wrong It's just because it's had trauma. Definitely stick with your doctor and or a therapist if you can. Just my advice Best of luck"

Thought I was dying, hallucinating, thought people were trying to hurt me while I was high, couldn’t move or see properly, extreme vomiting, and as things progressed I got stuck on the thought “maybe I already have died” which just exploded into more extreme panic. I was in that state (and refusing to sleep because I thought I’d never wake up) for about 10 hours. Then more of the same intense panic off and on for days following. I had really bad anxiety for a couple years after. Thankfully I’ve recovered from the anxiety for the most part now, but I will NEVER touch THC of any kind again.

","Congratulations, you've found out why many people are very much against THC use. It can cause anything from ""simple"" anxiety up to full blown psychosis *at first use* if you're either genetically or historically prone to mental illness. 

If you're lucky things subside after a while of no use (and I'd strongly recommend you never use THC again). If you're unlucky you've just found that certain actions can have absolutely shitty consequences. I'd however definitely talk to a doctor about it because there might be meds to help with the attacks at least. 

Hope it subsides on its own, noone wants anxiety. Good luck 😐"

",Sounds like you’re experiencing health anxiety now from the bad trip. Happened to me but from doing acid and seeing some very scary/unexplained shit in a shared hallucination. I thought my life was over. Couldn’t sleep at night unless I played a stupid app like candy crush to get my mind off my heart palpitations until I was so exhausted I couldn’t help but pass out. Couldn’t drive without the palpitations or workout. But I finally said fuck this and went to my primary care doctor and told them I needed help because shit was BAD. They started me on lexapro and hydroxyzine. Now 3 years later I’m just taking the lexapro (10mg/day) and everything in my life has improved even from before the health anxiety started. It kicked it pretty quickly after starting the lexapro but all I could think is “this is what it’s like for people who don’t suffer from chronic anxiety?”. I wish you the best. The first medication you try is not always the right one for you. Don’t give up. I almost did and I’m so glad I fought back and have an even better life for it

If you are in a red prohibition state, that can make you feel VERY self conscious about being high itself, and trigger major anxiety. Just possessing it in a red state and seeing cops can trigger an anxiety attack for me. I moved from Utah to Oregon and the feeling of freedom is very empowering. 

As for long lasting anxiety, there's probably way more psychology there than we realize. Physically, weed generally does not do that and only lasts a few hours or so. Could it make semi permanent changes in brain structure to SOME people? We would know a lot more about it if it had been legal to study scientifically. 

As for me personally, weed absolutely calms my anxiety. Just not all types. If I had anxiety, for example, about going to court or to sign a new lease etc. I couldn't smoke before. Even in a legal state. If I have anxiety from any number of things like a broken down car, or a lot of yard work to do... And especially anything that makes me angry. Boy, weed takes the rage right out of you. It's like a knockout blow to angry anxiety."

"Tripped on an edible 4 months ago, now I have recurring anxiety attacks.","About 4 months ago, maybe a little longer? I had a synthetic THC gummy and absolutely tripped tf out. Felt like I was dying. Vomiting, hallucinations, couldn’t see or talk. I was also out cold for the next 2-3 days and after I came to I had the worst feeling of impending doom. 

Ever since that happened I get random attacks, heart palpitations, fast heart rate, and my body jolts when I try to fall asleep. It’s not everyday, it’s random.

Well, earlier this afternoon I took Pamprin for menstrual pain. I didn’t realize it had drowsy antihistamines in it. I started to have another attack and it just now subsided.

Is this because of the gummy I ate? Did it just awaken my anxiety?? It’s the worst thing i’ve ever experienced and it keeps happening. ","Hey, sorry to hear about you going through this. I've gone through nearly the exact same thing, and somebody who hasn't gone through it couldn't imagine how horrible it feels. I've nearly called an ambulance because I thought my panic attack was a heart attack. Back in like 2018 I smoked weed for the first time, and did so habitually for about three months. Quit when i had a severe panic attack, and for the next month it felt like I couldn't get a full breath of air. Doctor told me it was generalized anxiety, basically my nervous system was in a state of higher agitation or alert or whatever you wanna call it constantly, and that's what was making me feel that way. This year I also had a relapse into anxiety attacks and generalized anxiety after having a terrible trip on an edible (dumb idea) and starting on Wellbutrin. I think part of it is that some people are just really sensitive to psychotropics and other drugs that alter their mental state/ state of consciousness and the altered state of mind they're in causes them to overthink and panic. Or at least that's how it is for me. 

Here's what has helped me so far. Cut out drugs and alcohol entirely or nearly entirely (a beer or two won't kill you but might still be unhelpful because alcohol depresses the nervous system) and reintroduce them after your anxiety is manageable. Meditate/do breathing exercises for 10 minutes in the morning and before you go to bed, and make sure to have a basic bedtime routine that you stick to. If you don't take time to wind down before bed or go to bed really late after a lot of screen time that can trigger it. If the panic attack is coming on it can help to find somewhere cold, or get an icepack and press it to the back of your neck (science behind that linked here [https://psychcentral.com/anxiety/vagus-nerve-cooling-anxiety#can-it-help-with-anxiety](https://psychcentral.com/anxiety/vagus-nerve-cooling-anxiety#can-it-help-with-anxiety) ). Besides that it helped me to see my doctor so that a professional could tell me that I was physically healthy, and that this was a nervous system/anxiety problem that wouldn't kill me and would go away on its own. This way when I was having panic attacks I could say to myself, ""You know what this is, you're gonna be fine."" And eventually it became more manageable, less frequent, and ultimately went away (until recently). It will improve over time and become more manageable, but it may be something that comes and goes throughout your life, and you should experiment with various coping methods to see what works best for you. 

I hope this was helpful and I'm very sorry you're going through this."

I agree with you, synthetic weed is horrible for the mind and unfortunately it's the younger generations that consume it because it's easier to obtain and (idk about now) usually cheaper.

The good thing is that we are now forced to rely on our mental fortitude to relax ourselves and de-stress, instead of chasing a high. I'm happy I feel a bit more mature than others my age that still overly consume and have a dependency. Not in a condescending way, just simply happy for myself that I can live a sober life. :) Good Luck!"

It does help to know i’m not the only one it’s happened to. I’m actually seeing my doctor quite regularly and because of family history and my current disease he’s making me see a cardiologist before he diagnoses me with anxiety. I was just thinking that this might be the cause of all my “heart” and breathing issues currently. 

Before I put it together I really thought I was just going crazy. Oh and, the day it happened my family did call an ambulance for me. But ofc there’s nothing they can do for that. If i could turn back time and never have taken it I woulddddd. I’d rather deal with pain from my IBD cause it’s such a scary feeling."
What the hell is happening with me? I am so angry on myself and scared.,"How bad I miss being happy. I have an anxiety since I was 14, and I am 23 now.

What is that one anxiety symptom that just doesn't want to go away for you?,,"Claustrophobia. It doesn't matter how well managed my anxiety and OCD are, the claustrophobia doesn't budge one iota. It is resistant to all interventions, treatments and logic. Nothing has worked, not even exposure. It is quite resilient and develops a resistance to exposure. I would have to do exposure 24/7 for it minimize by 1%. The moment the exposure stops, even for a day, that thing comes back with a vengeance. I am still avoiding elevators. I can't be in crowds. Will never be able to get on a plane, train or monorail. I can barely ride a bus. Can't get in a car unless I have access to manual locks and am totally familiar with the door handle. I can't even wear rings on my fingers unless they are two sizes too big and then I just use one of those little plastic sizers to keep them from falling off. I dread single public bathrooms with the door lock and no windows. I always make sure there are no traffic pile ups before I leave to anywhere. Ugh... I don't know why it's so ferocious. I have basically given up on it at this point. I'm just accepting it will never be managed."

I can't accept that I have to stop smoking cannabis," I have been a heavy cannabis smoker since I was 15. When I was 18 I experienced my first major panic attack (related to my consumption). It took me some time to recover from the panic attack, but I returned to cannabis a few months later. This crisis generated an anxiety disorder. I continued excessive consumption until I was 22 when I had another attack with very strong symptoms of mental fog. I had to stop studying for 2 months. Then as soon as I started to feel better I took cannabis again. Today I am 25 years old and I had a new attack with even more worrying symptoms than before, a big derealization, mental confusion with difficulty speaking spontaneously, immense difficulty concentrating, in short I really thought I had become schizophrenic. 

Now the symptoms have decreased by 75% after 2 months of hell, and I'm starting to think about cannabis again, it's horrible! As soon as I feel a little better and the anxiety symptoms disappear slightly or become acceptable for me, I think about when I could start smoking cannabis again, when it is the same cannabis that is causing all these symptoms! ! I can't imagine my life without cannabis, it's part of me, my personality, my habits, he's my best friend even if it's bad for me. I think the last attack I had was really very serious, I haven't even come out of it yet even though it's already been two months. I don't think I can afford to resume my cannabis use, because I have the impression that a new attack will generate far too serious symptoms. I am lost and depressed because of this. Is anyone in the same situation? How does he experience it?","I’m going through a similar situation, not as severe but I understand. I wasn’t a super heavy smoker but I really enjoyed it for a while until I greened out and now it causes me severe anxiety. I’m constantly paranoid that I’m going to become schizophrenic because of it. for the past few weeks it’s been especially bad, I believe I’ve been experiencing depersonalization/derealization but still I miss it so much I just want to get high again 😭 it just made everything better and now I can’t go back. I’m glad your symptoms got better with time, and I hope you’ll be able to stop thinking about it eventually. I think for a lot of people weed just stops being good for them after a certain point and it’s unfortunately best to avoid it after that. you’re definitely not alone in that."

I use to get panic attacks on a regular basis and would constantly feel my heart beating out of my chest if i got anxious at all.
I also stopped consuming caffeine at the same time so im sure that helped as well. It's worth it. I have tiny bits of anxiety nowadays but not nearly what it use to be. Do it for your own sanity.

Edit: 
I downloaded discord and joined the r/leaves discord chat. Super welcoming community on their discord and i have several accountability buddies that I keep in contact with daily. 

It feels amazing putting the constant anxiety in the past. Do it. Look at this way: If you're experiencing all of that at 25 years old, just imagine what you'll feel like at 35 if you dont stop. And Imagine you being 45years old dealing with this still."

I haven’t hit a week of no cannabis yet; I’m looking forward to my symptoms subsiding but I know it will be a process.

He was paranoid and thinking everyone was following him, looking at him etc.  I thought he was faking/looking for attention bc I didn't know about this effect at all.  I even took him to the ER still thinking he was faking and was playing out his ruse.  Boy was I wrong.  Anyway, he quit altogether.  This was just too much.

I must also share what a psychiatrist told me not long ago about derealization.  I had sky high anxiety a couple of yrs ago, and usually when I had panic attacks the derealization would last an hour or so.  This time it was weeks!!!  Anyway the doctor told me that derealization is a protective, coping mechanism that your brain does to protect itself from further injury.  You feel as if ""in a dream"" and although you don't like it, your brain is pulling itself back a smidge from reality for protection.  Knowing this fact helped me, and I hope knowing it helps anybody reading this not feel so disturbed or distressed from derealization episodes."

I quit for a year to go to tech school and was like “wow im getting better” and didnt even factor in that i wasnt smoking. Graduated and felt so good i started smoking again and after 2-3 months the symptoms started creeping back up. After a year or so i quit again for another 3 months to pass a drug test for a job and miraculously i started feeling better but again started smoking again cuz i didnt correlate the 2. Over the past few weeks using my amazing 20/20 hindsight im realizing how much better i felt when i wasnt smoking but im pretty bored at night unless i smoke so im having a hard time pulling the trigger again. The first 2 times i had to quit but this time it would be on me to decide to quit.

Now the symptoms have decreased by 75% after 2 months of hell, and I'm starting to think about cannabis again, it's horrible! As soon as I feel a little better and the anxiety symptoms disappear slightly or become acceptable for me, I think about when I could start smoking cannabis again, when it is the same cannabis that is causing all these symptoms! ! I can't imagine my life without cannabis, it's part of me, my personality, my habits, he's my best friend even if it's bad for me. I think the last attack I had was really very serious, I haven't even come out of it yet even though it's already been two months. I don't think I can afford to resume my cannabis use, because I have the impression that a new attack will generate far too serious symptoms. I am lost and depressed because of this. Is anyone in the same situation? How does he experience it?","Any chance you'd be open to see a mental health professional? Weed can be a pain in the butt when it comes to long term use, especially when starting from an early age.

A psychiatrist should be able to give you the right  medication and support that is really needed in those situations. Sincerely wishing you the best 💖"
I can't accept that I have to stop smoking cannabis," I have been a heavy cannabis smoker since I was 15. When I was 18 I experienced my first major panic attack (related to my consumption). It took me some time to recover from the panic attack, but I returned to cannabis a few months later. This crisis generated an anxiety disorder. I continued excessive consumption until I was 22 when I had another attack with very strong symptoms of mental fog. I had to stop studying for 2 months.

I quit when I was 28. Now I’m 45 and I just take edibles. I think the smoking part is what causing my panic!

I've always dealt with anxiety but then in the last few years my anxiety got worse. Sure there were days when smoking helped but then in the last year it started to make my anxiety worse. Smoking was no longer serving its purpose anymore...it was only making everything worse. I've now been 8 months sober from smoking. It was the best habit I've ever let go of. Now I'm free of cigarettes (8 yrs) free from alcohol (5 yrs). And I've never looked back. There are better things to do with your life than let ""bad habits"" dictate who you are or what you can become without them dictating you. Trust the process! Best wishes and prayers for you on your journey...you got this! 🙏"

What’s Your Anxiety's “Special Chair”?,"I want to share a great movie scene that helped me see anxiety in a new light.

It’s from Disney’s *Inside Out 2*, featuring the character of Anxiety, and it really made me reflect on how I manage my own.

For context, *Inside Out 2* personifies emotions like Joy, Sadness, and Anxiety as characters who live inside a young girl named Riley, helping her navigate life. 

Near the end of the film Riley is having a panic attack and at first the other charachters try to fight Anxiety and stop her. But when they come closer they see anxiety herself has lost control and they just hug her and give her comforting words.

 They realize that Anxiety isn’t the enemy—it’s a part of Riley that needs care and compassion. Furthermore, by the end of the film they're shown to have made a special corner for Anxiety with a cozy massage chair,  tea and they've learned to help her focus on what they can control in the moment.

That scene made me think: how often do we fight or ignore our anxiety instead of treating it with kindness? It also made me wonder: what’s *my* “special chair” and how can I support and comfort my inner Anxiety on a more regular basis and not let it grow crazy?

For me, I guess sometimes it can be stepping outside for fresh air, making a cup of coffee, or having a quick chat with a coworker to feel grounded. but many times I feel like I dont have the time or legtimacy to take those kinds of breaks at work but then again trying to focus with anxiety in your head is so hard.

What about you? What comforts or routines help you your anxiety? I’d love to hear your thoughts on what helps you","Mine is planning imaginary holidays. Gives me hope for the future, something to think about in the moment and often positive memories from better times in the past"

Wanting to end it soon & need a hug.,"In my late teens. I'm tired of living in such a shitty world. Nobody cares about anyone else and everyone's too self-centred to change. It's destroying them, but all they care about is control, and they'll take it from us if it means destroying the Earth, taking our humanity and lying to themselves. I wish I had the power to change everything. I could fix it. Even though I fucking hate everyone. I feel like I'm some sort of an entity or immortal stuck as a human. I understand most of the universe and what's outside of it. Not just my idea of it though. I don't know why but I just understand. I also don't think in words. It's pictures, sounds and frequencies. Faces, lights, pools of stuff I can't explain, ""numbers"" (not regular numbers, numbers more than everything and less than nothing), feelings that feel more than human, dreams and unearthly *things*. And nobody understands what I mean. I think I might be crazy. Strangely enough, I've only one thing that makes me feel understood; doctor who. It's odd, but the Doctor (specifically 10) *gets* it. He feels the weight of the universe and what its like to have nobody understand what he knows and feels. 
I've been told that it's probably just a teenager thing or because of my Aspergers or depression, which might be true.

Thanks if you've read all this, and I'd really appreciate a hug or something. ","What you said in this post shows me that you do care. The other 3 people who commented showed me that they care. You may not see it but the fact is that people do care, they’re just afraid to show it. You mentioned you like doctor who which I’m assuming is a show. Right? Taking your own life is like ending on a cliffhanger. What’s next in your life could be good or it might be bad, but at least give yourself the chance to see it. Live your life like a show. Be excited to dive in to the next episode. The world is a beautiful place with ugly people in it, and the world is an ugly place with beautiful people in it. Be the beauty."

There’s a theory in sociology called Dunbar s number that state we as humans arent meant to know and have connections with more then 150 people and modern society means we know everything abt so many ppl and so many communities  


The reality is u can’t fix everything, but u might be able to fix things in your community, in ur 150 ppl and communities together can fix society and slowly the world.

 If u feel like no-one cares you might be with ppl that are focused more on fixing there own life especially if your a teen. My suggestion go to protests, pick one or two causes and go to protests and groups and workshops and meet ppl through those. I remember the first time I went to a protest it was for the environment and it was amazing to see all these people making a ruckus abt something that needed to be fixed and it truly reminded me all humans look to make life slightly better, we’re just all at different stages of that. I hope that as life goes on you find your people and I hope that you put that drive to fix things to good use."

Idk what to do im trying to stay calm and hold out hope that my power comes on soon even though its 2:30 am. How can i calm down and stay calm im so scared ","First and foremost what helps me the most is to focus on taking some deep breaths. Next, get comfortable in either your bed/couch and grab a blanket. 

Trust me, just focus on deep breaths - big breath in - big breath out. Our minds are incredibly powerful, and just as our minds can spiral us into a panic attack - our mind can just as easily take us out of that state. 

Remember, you are not alone with this feeling! Everything will be okay :)"

"Do you sometimes think your friends arent really your friends, and they're only there to play this one big practical joke on you?","Growing up, I was bullied a lot, it was really difficult telling if they were making fun of me or not or if they are actually my friend.

Its socially stunted me. I really have a hard time trusting people. Now fast forward I'm into university. I meet really nice people, but again I'm very self aware if they're trying to make fun of me. 

It got to the point that someone who asked ""if we were friends"" as a genuine question after a month I got along with him. I said ""no"" to him for protecting myself. I later cried myself to sleep that night as I thought it was probably genuine. 

It was, I'm friends with this person and I have been on holiday with him and a few others, but even a small part of me feels like this is one expensive prank in the making even though it isn't.","Morning Marksism, hope your feeling okay? 

i was just browsing here as my own Health anxiety has skyrocketed these last few weeks through stress, but your post hit me as one of my underlying anxieties is exactly what you have described. sadly when i was 13-16 at school i was bullied, my ""friends"" basically Catfished me then decided to spread it around the school. it was the worst time of my life. i left school at 16 and entered the adult world of work they made me realise that life did not revolve around school or being popular. i decided to go back to college and met a new bunch of friends who shared a common interests. Also i managed to push myself to meet other people who shared my interests through various forums and groups. 

Even now at 40 its extremely hard for me to say i have really good close friends as when my anxiety is high i still expect to arrive at a place we are all going to expect to be dropped or it to have been a prank. The one thing that has helped is talking about it and telling them about my experience. it sounds counter intuitive i know as your worried about opening yourself up for potential harm but from what i have learnt its like ripping a plaster off. if you want to be friends with someone let them know your anxieties and issues if they do turn tail and run or decide to hurt you at least you haven't wasted your time wondering and you can move on to pastures new and chalk it up to experience but i guarantee the vast majority of people are nice and don't want to treat you like shit for a laugh.  
  
Also if you have any hobbies or interests try to meet people in the same vein you have more to bond over. 

Apologies if this is a bit of a mess its more of a train of thought than a well presented comment but i wanted to put something down for you so you know your not alone."

The right meds are there but it seems like you haven’t stuck to one long enough for it to work. Try diazepam for when it gets really bad and 100% do breathing exercises they do help.

I hope you get on the right track soon ❤️"
I need an emotional support animal,"My anxiety has been through the roof recently so much that I have barely left my house/bed in 7 months, I can’t sleep at night anymore, I can’t be productive, I feel paralyzed, I have horrible brain fog, I don’t socialize with anyone anymore and when  I do I feel extremely overwhelmed even with the people closest to me, I’m extremely paranoid and it’s starting to make me hallucinate noises and seeing things which has never happened before.

I have two cats but both are pretty independent at most times and if I need an animal with me when I’m having an anxiety attack, I can’t rely on them to stay with me all the time but when they do it really helps. I’m 22 and still go to my mom when I’m having an anxiety or panic attack whereas I would prefer having an animal companion with me which would actually help calm me down more. 

The other thing is that my cats don’t really get along with other animals and I’m unsure how they would be around a dog. After googling I found out that ESAs are very expensive ($15,000-$20,000) which I can’t even afford but I need some type of reliable companion. It’s a difficult situation but I was wondering if anyone had any insight on this.","No my psychiatrist retired last year but I have a long history of trying lots of medicines. Prozac, Wellbutrin, Buspar, Venlafaxine, Desvenlafaxine, Cymbalta, Trazadone, Xanax, Lexapro, Propanalol, and more. Even Xanax and Propranolol only do so much but they definitely help the most. 

My psychiatrist said I’m treatment resistant and I haven’t been back to see one since."

Are there any alternatives to Benzos to treat anxiety?,"I absolutely hate anti depressants. They make me feel manic and completely destroy my appetite and numb my emotions. I wish there was something out there that could just treat my anxiety without totally rewiring my brain and altering my personality. I have tried buspar but it feels like a placebo ( absolutely no effects) 

","There are for example antipsychotics, beta blockers, antihistamines and antixiolytics, but I don't think any of them treat anxiety in a way antidepressants do. They can help with the symptoms a lot, but not do much for long term effect."

When to take a benzo?,"Hi!
I (23f) got perscribed some benzos (bromazepam, 1.5mg), to take it when I need it. 
But my ""problem"" is that I am not sure when I need it or like when it is ""valid"" to take it? I had so many different severities of anxiety this month that I don't even know anymore how bad my anxiety is objectively. 

They want to put me on antidepressants, but that's gonna still take some time. And I changed environment this week and I have an exam coming up, so I an having some stressful days and some stresful days are still to come in the next two weeks.

And I want to take my medicine, but I already took it now 2 days in a row and that would make it I took 4 or 4.5 pills last week (sometimes I split a pill). And even tho I am taking the lowest possible dose and in the instruction of the medicine it says to take this medicine 1-3 times a day everyday, I still feel like I am taking my medicine too frequent. I am scared to getting addicted to the medicine, or that it will start to become less effective, or that I will use up all my pills before they give me anti-depressant and before they start and then I will need them, but my doctor will not want to perscribe me more because I used them up too fast.

I am anxious everyday, and I just want to take my pill every day just to feel normal again, but I know I shouldn't do that. And I try not to, since my anxiety is the worst in the morning and tends to get better towards the evening, so I try to get through it withouth my medicine with thinking ""It will be better later"". But yeah, idk.

Basically what I wanted to ask you in this long-ass thread is, when do you guys know it's time to take a benzo (if they had been perscribe to you to take it when you need it) and when it's not yet worthy of the pill? 

(Sorry for this long text, I have been an anxious mess lately 😅)
(Also I added the NSFW tag, just in case this is triggering to someone cuz of addiction and overthinking the medication 😅)","Honestly, I was on Lorazepam probably 5 or so years ago and I was wondering the same thing. I guess what worked for me was taking it ONLY when I was having a severe panic attack. To be honest though, every panic attack felt just as bad as the last so It was difficult for me to differentiate when to take a benzo. It basically just ended up being something I just took usually at night to get sleep when it felt like I was dying"

I haven't had any meds in the past two years and I was actually doing really well in the past few months except for occasional bad days.

Recently I asked my doctor for a Xanax prescription (0,5 mg) & I took maybe 6 pills (EDIT: not at once, I got that prescription ~2 months ago) and suddenly my anxiety is so much worse. 
I feel like my skin is sunburnt which is something that only happens when I'm stressed and in general I'm way more frightened than usually. 

Is it because of Xanax? It seems like the only explanation tbh

Has anyone ever passed out from their anxiety?,"I 25F struggle a lot with anxiety.

I have had to pull over driving multiple times and twice I had people come get me. Stopped driving for 5 years because of it.

I did pass out once when I looked at the stitches on my fresh surgery wound when I was like 13. That's the only time I can remember, but I definitely didn't have any type of anxiety disorder back then."

That sensation fortunately hasnt come over me in 10 years….but around that time I did have a random fainting spell (blood sugar suddenly dropped) and that kicked off about 4 years of horrible ptsd like symptoms all over fainting."

The effect is called orthostatic hypotension which just means a sudden drop in blood pressure. Its relatively common with blood pressure medications. With my disorder it seems to be my brain telling my body we aren't having a heart attack today and then it's lights out with me waking up on the floor not knowing where I am or what is happening. It's probably the scariest experience I've been cofronted with so far in life.

I got up from the couch and the entire house was spinning. I couldn’t stand. I felt like I was in the hull of a ship during a storm.  I grabbed the walls of my house to make it to my bed and ran my BP.  I was 170/110. I started trembling and freaked out so I called 911.  Paramedics ran every test they could.  By the time they arrived my HR and BP normalized.  

The next day I called my uncle who’s a retired neurosurgeon. He wrote a scrip for an MRI of my brain.  I got the DvD and drove straight to his house and we viewed it together. Everything was fine.  

Sometimes it’s good to get checked out for peace of mind.  Btw, after that my dizzy spells stopped and haven’t returned."

I also have lower then normal blood pressure, I took it 45 minutes after my dizzy episode once I got home and it was 106/66 so it could have been a low blood pressure spike as well. I understand the drunk feeling and have had to deal with it multiple times, but this one felt so different. I've never had full on vertigo with the feeling of puking and blacking out like this. That's why it scared me so bad. I'm sorry you got out on the wrong meds, it's hard to find a medication if you have low blood pressure because almost everything LOWERS it even more.

And yes exactly!! So many meds I just cannot take because of that and on top of it my hr can get pretty low sometimes, so I can't take any sort of beta blocker now either, and mental health meds just like... Do not work on me. I've tried so many. It's disheartening!

I then took a break and went back at it, and I think the anxiety and stress of dealing with so many people and being high strung just wrecked me.

I think AI is curing my anxiety,"I have horrible health anxiety and someone suggested to me that I talk to ChatGBT about it. My therapist is even going to start recommending it to other patients.

It’s nice because it remembers what you tell it and you can explain in detail what is going on (or what you think is going on) with you medically and it will tell you why everything is probably fine.

I have been panicking about a potential heart problem for months now despite lots of tests. I told ChatGBT about my tests and it keeps telling me I have <1% chance of having a heart problem. It also explains in detail why my symptoms are most likely anxiety and what I can do to help myself. I showed my doctor some of the responses and he agrees with it.

It’s definitely a great tool for in the moment when you’re worried about something and don’t have immediate access to a doctor. Not sure how useful it could be for other kinds of anxiety but let me know if you’ve also used it.","It can work but it has its downsides to be wary of. 

AI will never push back against bad behaviour or encourage you to do something healthy that goes against social norms.

It's a very insular type of therapy.

Again, it can work but it's up to the user to recognize its problems which is why I wouldn't like to see it being institutionalized."

Not sure how useful it could be for other kinds of anxiety but let me know if you’ve also used it.",Yeah I don’t use it for legitimate medical advice or as a substitute for therapy or anything but it’s helpful in the sense that when I’m panicking that something is wrong like if I’m having a panic attack and think it’s a heart attack then it gives me reassurance that it’s anxiety and will pass instead of rushing to the ER and wasting time and money to be told the same thing. It’s basically a personalized Google search which I find reassuring.
I think AI is curing my anxiety,"I have horrible health anxiety and someone suggested to me that I talk to ChatGBT about it. My therapist is even going to start recommending it to other patients.

It’s nice because it remembers what you tell it and you can explain in detail what is going on (or what you think is going on) with you medically and it will tell you why everything is probably fine.

I have been panicking about a potential heart problem for months now despite lots of tests. I told ChatGBT about my tests and it keeps telling me I have <1% chance of having a heart problem. It also explains in detail why my symptoms are most likely anxiety and what I can do to help myself. I showed my doctor some of the responses and he agrees with it.

It’s definitely a great tool for in the moment when you’re worried about something and don’t have immediate access to a doctor. Not sure how useful it could be for other kinds of anxiety but let me know if you’ve also used it.","Yeah, I recognize the ways it could actually help, I just worry about the future of therapy in the long term.

Not related to therapy, but for example, there was a study about young men using AI as a loneliness aid, virtual girlfriends and such. The result was that these men often retracted further from in person relationship because they started to be less tollerant compromises and arguments that could come from relationships.

That in itself is a problem and it will be doubly so when applied to therapy. An AI therapist is very good at telling you what you want to hear instead of what you need to hear. 

For example there are situations in which it would be healthy for a therapist to say that you are allowed to not be tollerant of a certain family memeber or friend if they deem the situation worthy of such a response. On the opposite side of the spectrum you as a patient may feel justified in certain anti social behaviour when it's not really necessary and a good therapist would help you unpack the emotional baggage and dissuade you from pursuing self destructive behaviour.

Modern AI softwares are yes men, could work very well insularly but clash against the complexities of human behaviour and society"
Scared out of my mind after climbing ,"so I recently climbed this tower here it was not a good idea, I don’t know if it’s a cell some more of the bigger Climbers like search query and climbmaxxer said I was fine but just checking in, I have anxiety so this puts a big part in it when I got home I was worrying about if I got bad exposure to rad or something idk what type of tower this is not am tho and I searched up symptoms and then I started feeinf them only when I searched and red them I have red spots that are itchy and hurt but I have been in the sun all week and it’s been hot and I have not wore sunscreen so that is most likely that and my arms have hurt but that might be from climbing and it feels like something in my throat but there’s not and my skin is realy dry and I have been thirsty and my stomach feels funky but this all happens when I get anxious so I am really confused whether I should go to doctor or if I am complete fine or sick or just goo and my eyes have been blurry and tired but that started before I don’t know I’m scared should I go to doctor or am I completely fine",You’ve answered your own question and stop climbing towers.
Anxiety has been terrible but never knew it was anxiety ,Wake up shaking bad keep having flashbacks about ex have terrible performance anxiety it’s been a rough stage been dealing with this since I was 15 but feel it getting worse any1 been threw similar and any tips I’ve started yesterday take 1 deep breathing at a time,"Just remember and keep in mind that everyone has (even if it’s just a bit) anxiety! Also, some ppl can’t control theirs and need outside help from either a psychiatrist and/or therapist and others may not. Some may need medication and others may not. That doesn’t mean those ppl who don’t need outside help are “better” or “luckier” than us, etc. It just means that they (or we) need to work on our well being a lil bit more than other people. That’s just the way it is, and there’s no shame in it whatsoever! 

Wow, so sry to vent! But with that in mind.. ur deep breathing example was a good one! Find a good psychiatrist (if u don’t already have one!) as well as a therapist who suits u well. Sometimes u may need to “shop around” just to see which therapist is best to help U with ur specific needs. I’m on my 3rd therapist myself. I would def say that finding the right doctors (psychiatrist and therapist) are the first steps u should work on when managing ur anxiety. Start there! Good Luck!!"

How to handle mean coworkers and spiraling thoughts,"Hi,
I just recently started a new serving job which I wasn’t sure I would get because my trial day went so horribly. My trainer Lisa was so rude to me that day just barking orders at me and treating me like an idiot when I didn’t know everything about the menu yet (didn’t study it profusely because it was a trial day). On that day, multiple other workers came up to me saying to “just ignore” Lisa because she was in a horrible mood. I figured something was just off and I ended up getting the job (which meant she would have had to tell the manager I was an alright worker because she was reporting to him about my performance). Cut to my first shift on a slower night but no formal training (this place just doesn’t have training shifts and throws you in and you either pick it up or you don’t). Another coworker, Mary, acts similarly and is annoyed when I have questions, corrects me in a passive aggressive way and then comes up to me after the shift and apologizes for being “bitchy” and then proceeds to call Lisa a bitch after I said that I had her for my training day. Let’s just say the b-word has been thrown around a lot even tho I’ve barely worked there for two weeks now…

Last night, Lisa got on to me about not doing something for her section (everyone else has told me it is a personal responsibility to do this when a table sits down) and rudely corrects me as if I’m an idiot and talks down to me. I was super thrown off because everyone has told me differently than she just reprimanded me for. I even went around after asking if I did it wrong and everyone says that I did nothing wrong. After the shift, she comes up to me and asks how I feel about the place and I say it’s fine to which she replies that I seem stressed and I say I’m just new and adjusting. The whole thing felt off and when I said I was fine she said she would understand if I was stressed but then just stormed off. 


I have a few coworkers that are just very normal and don’t treat me any certain way and are happy to answer questions but I feel like the rest just have something against me and I don’t know why. How do I stop this feeling of thinking I did something bad or am just not likable? ","I had a similar experience when i started my job, first couple weeks Dave was training me perfect and then i started working with Sue and she was an old 60yo grumpy bitch who thinks the world owed her something ant took that out on people like yourself and i who are just doing our best. Its not your fauly, people like Lisa and Sue make people like us think its our fault even tho it isnt. In terms of what to do... the #1 most important thing is anytime you are spiraling thinking about work while not at work, remember that Lisa is a stupid bitch and you are happy and live a nice and true to yourself life and you treat people kindly and with respect. Be proud of yourself for that. And remember thats something you can do and lisa cannot. Also you could tell your manager or hr. Hope i could help"

Should I(24f) follow my parents advice and just push through the anxiety and get a job so i can work overseas in scotand which is my dream? I havent been able to work for 5 years due to extreme social anxiety and my parents say i should just work even if I'm anxious:/,6 years ago worked in scotand and loved it but in my home country it is different as my brain associates it with being unsafe so my social anxiety is really bad here... even thinking about working makes me nausious its so bad to the point writing my CV takes me 6 hours. but i really want to go-to scotland. My parents say i should just work even if I'm anxious and just push myself but I'm so so anxious and get drained so easily like i did a jewelry course but after a few weeks it got so overwhelming i had to keep going home and napping and then i stopped going as i was so so anxious and i know i can't do that with a job.. thoughts,"Seek help. Therapist/doctor based on how severe your condition is. Anxiety had drained me and my confidence was down in the dumps. Therapy and medicines later helped me transform myself into a much more assertive, courageous outlook towards life. My life has become 10 times better. Seek help for your anxiety. It can be eliminated to a large extent and managed with right help. Hit me up in chat if you want to talk."

However, You sort of need to mentally prepare Yourself for exposure therapy and its temporary side-effects. It is likely that Your anxiety will be negatively impacted over a short term, increasing in intensity to a point where things click for Your body and it starts stressing less and less. Sooner or later, You will come to the point where You process more stress than You accumulate. 

You need to be aware of what's happening. Read up on exposure therapy for social anxiety. If You put in the work, the effort, accept that You will fall down and take the responsibility to get up again, it is a matter of time before You conquer Your anxiety. 

The process is different for everyone, for someone it's not too bad, for some it can not be understated how poorly they cope, however everyone gets out in the end. I guess the biggest help will be understanding that You have a trained behaviour that You are slowly breaking up with each exposure, regardless of how You react to the exposure at the beginning."

I don't mean to say it like that but you have to. It will help your anxiety if you do it. Working is very anxiety provoking and I'm not trying to be rude, just thinking about going to work tomorrow is making me kind of anxious but you gotta find something you like.

I mean I'm American, so I don't quite know what country you're from, (I'm also Scottish fun fact) but my relationship with work has been so weird and honestly hard. My dad was a construction worker so I always felt the need to do hard jobs but I found out at a certain age the most important thing is to truly do a job you love and keep trying til you find it

I've been a dishwasher and a janitor my entire life. I hate working. I hate going outside sometimes. I hate everything at times and I don't want to rely on government assistance or anything but I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I just try and show up to work every day"

And you can always go back home if it doesn’t work out.
anxious dream,"so i had a very horrible dream. a dream that had some girl as my wife and it was going smooth till she suddenly dies and her blood is all over the floor. her eyes are only showing, like bare fucking eyes with skeleton and this dream has been happening for like 2-3 days. she always gets in an operation and that somehow restores her body.

it just makes me so anxious waking up :(

Does anyone ever feel like you’ve been flashbanged ,"I have been prescribed Zoloft for the anxiety issues I’m currently experiencing, but every now and they I’ll be totally fine and all of a sudden it’s like a random way of anxiety just hits me, it feels like lights are brighter and I’m de personalised, kind of feels I’m not in control of my body and I’m just trying to hold everything together and not start freaking out, can anyone relate to this? And if so do you guys have any advice ",Yeah that's dissociation. It happens from experiencing stress. With anxiety that's common. Zoloft could help a lot with that.

And check my hormones as well since they tend to come more around ovulation. It's a very scary feeling. First started experiencing them only when i would shower since id be exerting or when i would bend down. Now I have anxiety because of it. Sigh.

My pcp gave me metoprolol which helped a little. But now I feel them more during ovulation and before menstrual cycle.

I’ve had a ton of stress since though and in October, they were happening non stop.. when I’m tired and when I’m stressed and feeling my anxiety is when they are the worst. I’m still not treating them with meds, but I know I could if I needed."

","I’m sorry this is your experience. I’ve been fortunate enough that my doctors never blamed anxiety and my cardiologists basically wouldn’t even say the word. I’m not sure about the shortness of breath, I did find I was holding my breath a bit cause it felt like it would give me heart palpitations. But basically if you’re experiencing heart palpitations in a structurally normal heart (which your ct and echo and ekg would have said), they are technically benign. Palpitations can be triggered by anxiety, but that’s not always the case (and well they’re anxiety inducing). What you should be getting is a holter monitor for a few days to find out your “burden” aka how many palpitations you get daily. This can change over time - be different day to day, or month to month. The beta blocker you have should help but maybe it’s not a high enough dose. It’s possible they’d recommend to increase it. Ultimately I was on the highest dose of my beta blocker and I still had a 16% burden and many nsvt runs and I ended up getting an ablation."
Pinched nerve in my back + severe panic attack... the perfect shitstorm. ,"I have been dealing with anxiety and panic for nearly 30 years. Been through panic attacks so strong I passed out. Trips to the ER thinking I was having a stroke or a heart attack, months on end of poor sleep/insomnia, agoraphobia, depression.  You get the idea.  

Thought I'd experienced all that my mental illness had to offer.  Then, about 40 minutes ago I pinched a nerve or did something bad to a muscle in my back.  The immense wave of pain set off my panic response almost immediately. 

  Proceeded to try and breathe through the pain and panic only to discover that whatever I've done to my back makes taking a deep breath extremely painful.  Like I can totally take a deep breath if i want to, but holy fuck the pain. Problem is that %85 of my coping mechanism for panic is deep breathing.  Perfect.  😂

So now I'm sitting here white knuckling this panic attack and frantically typing (apologies for the misspellings and typos) this as a way to distract myself from it.   

I have no particular reason to post this, but maybe my silly situation will distract somebody else from their own panic spiral.  Be safe and be good to yourselves.  ✌️",Hey you'll be fine. You've gone through the worst of the worst that anxiety has to offer. Nothing else can affect you now trust me. You are invincible and strong! You are in control of yourself! What you and us all are feeling are exaggerated stress responses. But they won't harm us!

Always nice to hear from someone who understands what it's like and is willing to send some encouragement through the ether.

Please help my brain has convinced itself that I can't sleep without headphones and now I get doom and anxiety when I try to sleep without it,"I'm suffering so much, how do I unlearn this asap it is ruining my life

I get impending doom for no reason cos just for one split second my brain said I cant sleep without headphones and listening to something that now if I attempt to sleep without it the way I used to

My brain and body go in to anxiety and impending doom mode 😭😭 ","Safety behaviours are things we do to keep anxiety away.

We all have different safety behaviours. 

You need to show your anxiety that you are safe without your headphones. That things are ok.

You could try limiting your time with headphones at night ...bit by bit untill you don't need them.

Or possibly reading instead ? Until you get sleepy.

Or play some music on the headphones next to your bed without putting them on.

Feelings of doom are very common with anxiety and feel worse at night. You aren't alone there !

Good luck . You will be ok."
I hate that my own events are traumatic while for others it's just normal  ,"TW: Discussion of Vomiting and Sexual trauma

I deal with panic disorder, GAD, OCD, and used to have PTSD from ages 13 to 17, which I got from a food allergy attack. It hit me today how annoyed I am that events in my life are just little whoopsies to others when they face them. For example, I remember at age 13 a girl with the same allergy as me had an attack a day before and was telling the group I was sitting at. I asked her ""Aren't you terrified now?"" and she just kind of shrugged and said it was just an accident. Here I was not eating and scared to touch anything in public while this girl wasn't even asking if this snack had her listed allergies and just took a risk right in front of me.

I also have a huge fear of vomiting. I think I always had but I remember this specific fear started after my PTSD. Having constant panic attacks in public and at home. I did vomit a few years later with a specific medication. I was traumatized all over again. I remember in my senior year of high school a girl said she felt like she had to puke and I left the classroom.

Today I was with some friends, and I asked how everyone's college experience went. This one guy was just talking about how he drinks with friends and violently puked to the point where he couldn't breathe and almost had to go to the hospital. But he still drinks, and he still can put himself in similar situations. These situations happen to a LOT of my friends, and still drink and still don't actively fear about it. 

A year ago, I put myself into a situation where I was ""friends with benefits"" with a guy that I kind of liked at the time. Without having real experience (although having some bad internet experiences) I thought I wanted this more than anything. I remember we planned to ""hang out"" at his dorm that following week. Even though I knew the guy and knew he was a very chill/nice dude I remember that being the worst week of my life. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, I was having panic attacks every day. The night before I got two hours of sleep and a panic attack that lasted 5 hours. It was pure hell. But I knew that ""hookup culture"" was ""supposed"" to be a normal thing, in a sense of saying it was just a chill thing. It was normal for people to just hook up, having no feelings but just having fun with it. Hell the guy I was hooking up with did this every week with multiple women and here I was feeling like it was the end of the world. But because events where I found to be traumatising were just normal for others, I pushed myself to do it. I convinced myself so hard just for the feeling that I could fit in more. 

These were just a few but main examples I think about. Why am I not normal? Why can't I drink and be okay puking, or thinking in my head ""oh it just means your body is getting the toxic stuff out so you don't die"". Why does every event push me to the edge? I feel like I can't fit it. I don't know anyone else who feels this way, and I feel so incredibly alone. I overreact to everything. ","You’re definitely not alone in feeling this way as I’m the same! I’ve had severe food allergies since I was 5, and my main allergic reaction was throwing up. Even got hospitalized for my allergies. I’m 23 now and still have a genuine phobia of vomit because of those reactions, both for myself getting sick and especially if other people around me feel/get sick. 

Living in the college dorms made my anxiety skyrocket on the weekends knowing other kids were partying so much that they’d be sick. My antidepressants + being a light weight make me very sensitive to alcohol where I easily get nauseous after one drink. Pretty sure part of the reason I always feel like throwing up when I drink is because I get so anxious about throwing up before I even start. 

One situationship earlier this year was me regularly hooking up with this girl, and I was so distraught when it ended. AND recently I went out with a different girl for 2-3 weeks only. I was falling for her so hard and fast because she was so charming that my anxiety was horrible since it was supposed to be casual only. I couldn’t eat, sleep, study for a huge exam that’s necessary to pass for my career, and I was constantly doing deep breathing bc I felt like I could get sick from my anxiety at any second. It ended literally 2 weeks ago when she suddenly blocked me without warning despite our last date being a few days prior to where she talked about future date ideas, saying she wants to still see me, and kissing me…🙃 It’s sent me over the edge and into a spiral, so I’m trying to get back into therapy. 

Sorry this is so long, but clearly we are basically the same. This was a rant for me too because it can be so frustrating being like this when it seems everyone else around you is so chill about anything and everything. We’ll keep powering through somehow. <3"

We are all wired differently and how we respond to past events and bad experiences can make us hyper-vigilant. We can even get stuck in fight, flight or freeze mode.

Some people do okay with one or two bad events but maybe a third one will put them over. For others, it only takes one traumatic experience. Your amygdala is sending fear signals because it’s stored those memories.

It basically goes back to survival mode. Your brain doesn’t know the difference between running from a bear like your ancestors might have down or someone throwing up. Especially with having PTSD, Do you carry an Epi-pen? That should give you some peace of mind regarding the allergies.

You are not alone. I am very similar in that I just don’t like over drinking. Not fond of the feeling and not fond of the possible after effects. I don’t like being out of control. Not everyone enjoys being out of their mind drunk. 

There are therapies for treating what you’re going through. It can help desensitize you from over exaggerated or unhelpful fears and trauma. There is nothing wrong with you. You have a brain that’s very good at detecting trouble."

Me and another person said something to our friend and she got mad so the other person apologized and i was going to but i couldnt speak, look at them, move, and my sight blurred and i started seeing stars (i think i stopped breathing) until they snapped me out of it.

Sorry for the bad grammar. 😅",In my personal opinion and this is just opionion the tablets will just prolong your recovery try exposure therapy
Weird sensation as I fall asleep(very weird) help,"So this is going to be a little lengthy I apologize in advance but I promise it leads up to what I'm going to say...
My whole life I've suffered with panic attacks I've been through the ups and downs,  the in-betweens.. I've taken the meds, I've done therapy I've done it all. I haven't had panic attacks for many years but one night a few months ago I woke up and had a really bad panic attack and it lasted for about a week or two. Then I talked myself out of it mostly sporadically here and there. And all of my 36 years I've learned to calm  myself down for most things that my mind brings to me to cause panic attacks. 

However after I had this recent panic attack every time I go to sleep I get this weird sensation that's very hard to explain. It's like a rush from my chest to my head, and then I get these very vivid images.... They range very widely but nothing scary or gruesome or anything of the sort. Animated pictures, People's faces that I don't know, weird stuff. Ever since I had that panic attack every time I go to bed this happens. My heart races for a second after it happens but then I tell myself I'm fine... I'm still conscious and I still know that it's weird. I just cannot explain why its happening, so I'm battling my fears. 

It's causing me many late nights not able to sleep because I know it's going to happen and I can't explain why. I can open my eyes and calm myself down pretty quickly and then usually after a few hours I finally fall asleep without knowing it. 

Just a little context I do not use any drugs nor have I ever in my life except weed in my teen years I'm 36 now. I do have high stress in my life and my job. I have a pretty regular sleep schedule as I get up everyday at 5:00 a.m  for work and I'm home by 4:30 p.m.. I drink on occasion but rarely.. I was on sertraline but not fluent I was very bad at taking them regularly. This was a while ago... Since this has started I went to my doctor and was prescribed Lexapro. I'm on day two today, and the last couple days I haven't had anything happen when I fell asleep but tonight I did. It was very intense and kind of made up my mind think that it had something to do with the depression meds. I know that no one on here is a doctor but I'm just hoping that someone has gone through something similar and can make me feel like a human being again because I feel insanely unreal or like something is causing this I need to address...

Yes I've started counseling and yes I've tried to explain this but no one really gives me answers from my doctor to my therapist. It always comes back to a hypnagogic hallucinations but I'm not asleep I'm just falling asleep, and maybe that is what it is,  I just need some validation that somebody else has went through this. If you've read this far I really really really appreciate your time and advice on the matter. I just want to know what's going on with my mind or relate to another and talk it out. Thank you",This has happened to me too. Not recently but there have been times in my life where I would see weird images when I closed my eyes at night. Stretched out faces and odd stuff. Idk why it happens but you’re not alone!

Weird sensation in chest,"Not sure this is the right sub to post this, but it does make me hella anxious.

Yesterday, I (15F) had this weird feeling in my chest that I really don't know how to describe. It's not pain, not tightness, no palpitations, more like a tingling sensation that bothers me and I'm pretty sure it's from the heart. It happened multiple times yesterday and also today. It usually lasts for up to 5 seconds and happens randomly. Last time I had it was today after lunch (I don't know if it's food related but I think not, because like I said it happens randomly). I always check my pulse when it happens and my heartbeat is perfectly normal.

I feel the need to mention that I have anaemia and take iron supplements.

The sensation is somewhat tingly and overall I feel like there's something wrong there. I really don't know how else to describe it.

Does anybody know what it might be?","Is it fluttery? That happens to me. Tingly, fluttery feeling. I think it might be palpitations or just a physical anxiety symptom. Don’t worry about it."
Health anxiety and Hospital,"My anxiety’s been so wild lately. A few days ago I had some worrying symptoms with my ibs and so I went to A&E at the advice of 111. I was there for nearly 7 hours (I even hyperventilated at one point so bad I nearly passed out). When I finally saw a doctor he was very dismissive and kind of told me I’d panicked over nothing (I now know he was wrong- it’s a whole story) but I was so tired I just took what he said and left (it was 4:30 am by this time).

Anyway, ontop of dealing with these worrying symptoms, I now have developed a sore throat. Anyone else would just deal with it but of course I have to wrack my brain to try and figure out what it might be and where I got it from- and if it might turn into something worse because I may have got it from the hospital. My anxiety is through the roof and I’m just so tired of it.","Ah, don't you just hate it when people can have a medical condition AND anxiety... Crazy you could have both huh..."

I mean to wait 7 hours to have a 2 minute chat and a quick exam to just be dismissed is so irritating. I actually ended up calling 111 again the day after because the symptoms got worse and they sent paramedics. They checked my vitals and since they were fine they said I wasn’t actively dying so they wouldn’t take me to hospital- which made me feel even worse.

It was a holiday and I started the day with going to the toilet bleeding out of my butt. I already had anal rips and there would be just a couple drops of blood on the toilet paper and that was that. Now the toilet bowl was filled with drops actually falling down, not just coming from the external part. 

Spent 10 hours in the ER, they did a blood test, took an echo and sent me home saying everything was fine and I probably just had a hemorrhoid pop open. Went to a specialist, who exploded a bit (aimed at the other doctors not me) 'you're telling me you've got bechterew and bleeding inside your intestines, and they sent you home without checking for Crohn's??'

There were no hemorrhoids to be found, I got the check for Crohn's and that luckily came up negative, but even so I was calmed down because this doctor had at least actually checked out the situation inside of there and not found any damage or anything that needed additional checking out.

Because of switching medications I eventually found out it was IBS, and that's now under control because of that same medication.

Having to suffer through something is one thing. Doctors not even taking it serious and not even doing the necessary tests when they're not even invasive, then getting sick of you being anxious about the uncertain situation, is something else though... I call it professional mental abuse..."

This was the last day of my period and so much fresh blood is not going to happen on the last day but he wasn’t having it. I’m still bleeding when I go to the toilet and my period ended days ago.)
He checked and couldn’t find haemorrhoids but I’m hoping I do have them and he just missed them because the idea of it being anything worse is too much for me to handle rn.

I had a colonoscopy earlier this year concluding ibs. It sucks."

Like, I'm sorry dude, I've been stuck inside my body for 28 years... I know which hole I'm bleeding from, trust me 😅

Yeah, the flare ups from IBS could make you strain in such a way that you get little rips inside of your intestines as well apparently. It's nothing really dangerous or permanent as they do heal back up. But of course preferably you'd not have them and not have to worry about them either.
Do you have particular firmer poop lately? 
(And not to sound like an old male doctor lol, but I've got endometriosis as well, so my IBS flare ups were actually timed with my periods mostly as well because that last part of my period would have me in such constipation... That could be causing the extra straining and getting small rips inside the intestines... It would take up to a full week after to completely go away, and then about 5 days more until I also didn't feel old wounds reopen again by having 'normal' bowel movements...)"

They said because I’m only bleeding on the toilet and not constantly it’s not majorly concerning. I’m going to contact my GP tomorrow by advice from the paramedics. The fact that this has all happened over a weekend just adds to the stress because the doctors surgery is shut 😭"

Genuine fear i have cancer or a brain tumor,So last year i had my first panic attack while i was on molly and thought i was having a heart attack or cardiac arrest. Night passed and i was good but a week and a half later i checked my pulse and idk why (thats what i was doing when i first had my panic attack) and noticed my heart rate beating faster and then i started feeling like disconnected from myself and i feel drunk and im not. My eyes feel heavy and its like dizzy but not the best i can describe it to is drunk. And then i had another panic attack a few days later and thought i was having a heart attack and went to the er and was fine. Ever since ive had this feeling in my head for over a year now and it doesnt go away and all i can think its a brain tumor. It genuinely makes my life so miserable and lately ive had really bad anxiety. Idk what it is and my doctor doesnt take me seriously anymore. I just wanna feel normal again and im so scared its something related to my brain. Idk if this is all caused because of that 1 panic attack on molly or im actually slowly dying and i feel so helpless. Also have sore lymph nodes on my groin and neck and idk what it is and im genuinely scared.,"All of what youre describing is pureply anxiety symptoms! Dont worry, you’re healthy 
I have hypochondria too and i know what youre dealing with. If u ever feel panicked please dm me im here:) youre healthy"

It gets better you just have to take one day at a time and reassure yourself it’s just anxiety even though everything in your head is telling you it’s something else. Trust your docs. If it was something terminal they would tell you. It would look extremely defaming on them to misdiagnose you like that. You got this! Just try some breathing exercises. I take a combo of fish oil and magnesium to help keep me calm daily, it really works wonders. If you don’t feel better soon, I would try them."

heightened anxiety After you get your period?,"hi! i (19F) was diagnosed with a panic disorder a few months ago and also started getting medicated exactly two months ago. for the most part, the meds worked great. before them, i was constantly nauseous, dizzy, and in a state of derealization overall. now, i feel like a normal person again. however, starting about two days ago, ive been experiencing those anxiety symptoms again. not as bad as before (thank god) but enough for me to notice and start worrying that ill need to increase my dosage or something.

the thing is, i started getting those anxiety symptoms again at (i think) the same time my period ended. or rather, started to end. so now im wondering if it cld be a result of that. 

has anyone experienced something similar? is this normal or shld i consider asking my psych if i need to increase my dosage? 

TYIA to anyone who can help me out!","This is not uncommon!! Periods are a huge fluctuation in hormones, so can absolutely cause anxiety. Definitely see if it continues after your cycle! But also important are you off your period or is it tapering? The week before it starts or right before you get it can also make anxiety worse :)"
Panic Attack? ,"So about two days ago I was sitting down and I suddenly felt like my heart was racing really fast…maybe fluttering?? It lasted about 10 seconds and I started feeling hot and flight or fight mode. I was about to call 911 but then I felt better. Immediately after this I took my blood pressure 123/75 pulse 84 I waited about another minute and re took my blood pressure 103/71 pulse 86. I have a doctors appointment until 12/24…soonest I can get in. 

Previously, this has happened to me but it usually lasts 2 or 3 seconds and I have discussed with my dr. I’ve had an electrocardiogram and it came out fine.

Is this what they call a panic attack? Anxiety attack? Are they even the same thing?

I do suffer from occasional anxiety but I don’t take any medications. 

","Panic, by definition, should be fear taking over other emotions and rational thought. If You have felt so, then yes. Otherwise, it is just a surge of adrenaline and heightened anxiety, since You suffer from an anxiety disorder. Anxiety attacks are not necessarily a thing."
Panic Attacks/Anxiety Constantly - Any advice?,"Hello Reddit,

To start things off, I’m a 31 year old male - considered over weight and do not exercise often other than at work. I have quite the busy work/home life so it does make it quite difficult. I take Lexapro 20mg daily (Anxiety) and Pantoprazole 40mg daily for GERD. 

I’ve been suffering from severe panic attacks that are quite disabling. Just as an example - I’ve been admitted to the ER probably 10-15 times in the past year and probably the same the year prior. This is a very lonely and isolating condition that my spouse tries to understand but doesn’t quite get it when the episodes occur. I basically shut down and go into fight or flight - head into the room, close the door and try to
Meditate while the wife is stuck with all the kids for which I feel so bad for. This has been going on for 5 years and is emotionally breaking me because it happens so often. 

Now my primary doctor has diagnosed me with GERD and said that my severe GERD attacks may trigger more panic attacks - for which they do. He’s got me checking my blood pressure for the next 30 days. 

My blood pressure about 30 minutes ago was 163/110 which I’m sure you can imagine - I start going into fight or flight and start contemplating the hospital/calling 911. I fought through it and and now my BP is sitting at 145/97. I feel like things are just not improving - I’m losing my mind here because I have kids and a job and a wife. This is hurting my family and my work. I’m also the sole provider for my household so I have to get through this somehow

Any advice is appreciated ",I'm going to dm you brother

Now my primary doctor has diagnosed me with GERD and said that my severe GERD attacks may trigger more panic attacks - for which they do. He’s got me checking my blood pressure for the next 30 days. 

My blood pressure about 30 minutes ago was 163/110 which I’m sure you can imagine - I start going into fight or flight and start contemplating the hospital/calling 911. I fought through it and and now my BP is sitting at 145/97. I feel like things are just not improving - I’m losing my mind here because I have kids and a job and a wife. This is hurting my family and my work. I’m also the sole provider for my household so I have to get through this somehow

Any advice is appreciated ",Have you seen a therapist ?
Still awake ,"I posted earlier tonight about having an anxiety attack and being super fixated on my heart rate. I’ve gotten about an hour of sleep, my shakes and chills came back (no fever), heart rate still fluctuating. Idk what to do - the local hospital won’t tell you if they’re busy or not - I don’t know if this is an emergency or just my anxiety. I feel silly. I’d hate to go there and it just be an anxiety attack. They’ll judge me, my family and boyfriend would judge me. My usually coping isn’t working though and I’m not sure what else I can do other than stay awake and be miserable. ",I have been there. Anxiety can really mess with your heart rate. I used to have my heart racing just laying down for bed. What always helped me was asmr thunderstorm sounds. I would put in my earphones and just lay down and listen to the rain and it just gave me something to focus on and would calm me down.

Anxiety can be hell on earth. Have you tried taking a calming bath or shower?

I find that usually relaxes me enough to fall asleep.

One thing I will say, you will be around tomorrow, try some grounding techniques. Listen to some calming sounds or podcasts.

I really do hope you can relax enough to sleep. Sending good vibes your way."

You can also do a body scan. Take a deep breath, hold for a few seconds, and then exhale as if you are blowing out of a straw. Try to make your exhale longer than your inhale. Start at your head and work your way down. Imagine that you are bundling up the anxiety in that region of your body and exhaling it out."

I’ve decided I’m tired of my allergy fears taking over and ate chipotle again this afternoon. One day at a time!! ,Nice one!!! Well done for fighting back op!!
Weird anxiety thing? ,"Does anyone else experience this weird thing where you’re anxious about something and then you happen to see more things about it in your day to day life (like social media, random conversations) and take it as a “sign”?

With my health anxiety I will focus on one thing and start to get more anxious whenever I see it brought up while scrolling on tik tok or if it comes up in a random conversation and I take it as a sign it’s true. 

I feel like I’m the only one this happens to!","Yup. 100%. I feel it's very common. You look for signs and patterns to reinforce your anxious thoughts. The things you are noticing are nothing and were always there... you're just attaching a meaning or purpose to them now. Normally they'd go by and they wouldn't even register in your brain. The universe isn't trying to give you a sign, trust me man. You're 100% fine."

I feel like I’m the only one this happens to!","As an EMDR therapist, I can assure you this is common! It’s called the **Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon** (or frequency illusion), where focusing on something—like a red car—makes you notice it everywhere. With health anxiety this effect amplifies because your **threat response is on overdrive**, constantly scanning for “proof” of danger.

When this happens, try a simple grounding exercise: pause and label what’s happening as “anxiety amplifying my focus.” Then, shift your attention by naming five things around you that are unrelated to your fear. This can help break the loop and bring you back to the present moment. You’re not alone in this! 💛"

I don’t think there is a particular solution to this because it’s just your mind playing tricks on you and you have to convince yourself somehow that those signs are not true. It’s just like those people that think ones zodiac sign and the solar system can tell what a persons personality is like. It’s just selective perception. 

What I think is very helpful though is limiting your time on social media. Especially Tiktok created an algorithm for me that showed me more and more content about dangerous health conditions like cancer and more. I feel like this app has nothing positive to contribute whatsoever. Same with IG"

The classic example happens when you are buying a new car. Once you settle on one or two models you like, you suddenly start seeing those cars everywhere when you never noticed them before.

This is perfectly normal, it's just an artifact of how our brains have evolved to notice things. Part of it is absolutely confirmation bias, the two phenomena overlap a lot.

The only think to take from this is to \*NOT\* take things like 'signs' seriously because you understand it's just a trick of our psychology."

Withdrawals from escaping anxiety?,"Withdrawals?

42 male. Struggled with chronic stress and anxiety for 20 years. My head is too strong so the stress and anxiety mostly manifests with physical symptoms.

I have been kind of self medicating my stress and anxiety with dopamine. Basically daily I have been glued to my phone, working hard, watched porn and masturbated, anything to keep my mind busy. I sometimes meditate but lately been to stressed to be able to.

Week ago I made a change. I stopped porn, reduced masturbating, reduced screen time a lot, reduced caffeine, started to meditate. Couple of days where okay but now every day I have felt increasingly more anxious. I have weight and pressure on my chest, head, headache. I have heart palpitations every time I try to do deep breathing or relax.

I know it’s stress but I can not cry (going to therapy to work on it), so there is no channel to let it out.

Can this be withdrawals from cutting down dopamine and running away from anxiety? Anyone can relate? I hope time will ease but for now I feel like going back to my old habits as this is not very fun…",[deleted]

Breathing Problems at Night,"A few months ago, I developed anxiety and panic attacks due to a condition. It got a lot better, however, and my panic attacks disappeared, but my anxiety still comes and goes. A few weeks ago, I started experiencing difficulty breathing every time I tried to sleep.

I almost felt like I was going to have a full-blown panic attack, but I didn’t. Anyway, is this anxiety or mild panic attacks? Or could this be something else? I’m always scared that it might be something else, even though I’ve done all kinds of tests. Have any of you experienced something similar?",Difficulty breathing? Can you describe it?

Med swap,Just curious I took Mirtazapine for 2 nights and I’ve stopped as I want to take another medication because I think will be better for me.

Rhodiola ,"I recently tried Rhodiola for the first time on an empty stomach and experienced a headache and blurry vision that lasted throughout the day. I’m wondering if this is a common reaction when starting Rhodiola, or if I should stop using it. Would it be better to take it with food?

I had one lump a few weeks ago under my right arm, which the doctor thought was an infected hair follicle. 1 round of antibiotics later and it went away. 2 weeks later another one comes up, I went back to the doctor and saw a nurse, who thought it was lymph nodes, but he spoke to the same doctor who saw me last time and she was fairly sure it was another blocked hair follicle, and prescribed another round of antibiotics.

I had one lump a few weeks ago under my right arm, which the doctor thought was an infected hair follicle. 1 round of antibiotics later and it went away. 2 weeks later another one comes up, I went back to the doctor and saw a nurse, who thought it was lymph nodes, but he spoke to the same doctor who saw me last time and she was fairly sure it was another blocked hair follicle, and prescribed another round of antibiotics. This time they did not work. I now have raised lymph nodes under both arm pits. They are very painful and have been there about a week. Today they seem to have grown more and are VERY painful. I have no other symptoms, but EVERYONE around me is unwell, and it's insane I haven't come down with symptoms of something.

i’m so scared i have breast cancer.,"i’ve (26F) been having pain in one of my breasts for a month now, at first i thought it might be muscular but it hasn’t gone away. it hurts when they move and especially when i press on the side (worst place!! that’s close the the lymph nodes!!). i went to my gyno who said he didn’t feel anything obvious, but is sending me for an ultrasound and mammogram since i have a history of fibroadenomas.

i have very dense breasts so maybe he missed something small ?? i’m trying to get an appointment ASAP and i’m so scared that it’s too late.. i keep seeing things about breast cancer pop up randomly online and it’s making me spiral. some younger women saying pain was their only symptom!! i’m going on vacation next weekend and im praying i can get this done this week because i’m losing sleep worrying about this. but what if im gone and get told i have something suspicious??

i wouldn’t be feeling pain for a MONTH if its nothing.. i’m not pregnant and don’t get my  period because of birth control.. so it can’t be hormonal.

i don’t know what to do. i feel like it’s too late and every day that goes by it’s only spreading getting worse and worse. i just got married and i don’t want this happening. i’m so scared.","(19f) i'm currently worrying about my case, too. but instead of pain, there's a lump in my boob. i had it checked last year, but the doctor told me it was normal. this year, i'm no longer convinced and i've been getting paranoid.

sending hugs to you. : ( i hope we can't through our fears."

I cant relax and stress and feel sick if i notice them and my brain wont stop looking for it. I was fine most of the year.

However as mentioned last few weeks were tough. I get these attacks where i have to sit down and calm down when im in busy places. Noise and busy places make me feel bad. However being at home also triggers attacks sometimes, even tho i dont know the cause. Then after a few hours ill feel okay again. But i am scared of the next attack and feel like i have GAD. I dont know how to try and fix it. Breathing does not work"

How to live a healthy life in a world of artificial foods//having body pains in your 30s? ,"Hi, I am a 28 year old female. I would say I have an active lifestyle. I gym 2-3 times a week, run around with my 11 month baby, and i also have a relatively healthy diet. (Especially if i compare it to what I've been eating) i used to eat so much chocolate in a day, soda drinks every other day, white rice, fatty foods like burgers, etc. Now I very rarely eat chocolates, no soda drinks for over a year, switched to quinoa and bulgur instead of white rice, etc. I used to hear people around me say 'once you hit 30, you'll have random areas in your body hurting' Similarly, I have been hearing a lot about how our food is artificial and has additives and preservatives. Our grandparents were so strong physically, even if they were not in good financial conditions or if they were 'struggling' with no time to exercise or so. And it's probably because the god they ate was natural and fresh. Butter, milk, vegetables. Now, whenever I'm eating healthy things, I keep wondering if it's even natural or real. Our vegetables come in plastic wraps in stores, every product you buy has some sort of agents in them, is the milk in milk cartons even real? Why are some fruits unusually big? Why are chickens bigger? Are they adding growth hormones? I live in Scandinavia and I thought things were healthy here, but now I'm not sure.

And then every other day, I have some pains, sometimes leg, sometimes hands, etc. I've had health anxiety as well the past 2 years, so i kind of dont know if it's because of that or because I'm actually weaker now.

But I fear about the foods we eat. Sometimes in a hurry if we're going out somewhere, i get storebought baby food for my baby and i feel so guilty about it because i feel like there are additives in it as well.

I keep worrying what the future will be like health wise. When i ask my mom/mother in law if they feel like this, they don't. They still feel ""healthy"" compared to their age.

Am I thinking too much?",Sounds like you have anxiety around food. Maybe possible an eating disorder. Go see a therapist.
Anyone else get anxiety about owning a pet?,"My partner wants to get a dog at some point, and I have so much anxiety about getting one, with the following you around constantly, jumping, barking, whining, the constant daily tasks to do for them, medical expenses, the hair everywhere. I don’t know how I will ever get over this anxiety, and I feel that I’m preventing my partner from doing something they truly want to do. I always said we would do it one day until I really sat down and considered the reality of it. I feel this way and then feel bad for feeling that way, trapped in an endless cycle. Anyone else?","Get pet insurance, or look into petco pet plans. 
Not all dogs shed bad, I had a Scottish terrier and he was a very low shedding dog, I currently have two boxers and a blue heeler mix and the can shed like crazy. Puppies want a lot of attention but they can eventually grow out of it as well. All dogs have their own personality and it’s also important to get a dog that fits your lifestyle."

Anyone else?","not exactly the same thing, but i got a kitten and did have a lot of anxiety at first. i got covid about a week or two after he came home, so i had to leave some of the care to my other family members while i was quarantining, but id be wondering if he was lonely, if he was okay, then waking up if he needed me, getting up early to feed him, having him around me all the time when i was used to being alone was a lot to deal with. 

i've had him for almost 3 years now, and he's overall helped me a lot. i used to spend a lot of time isolated in my room with my door closed, and loved my alone time. now i have to keep my door open at all times so he can go roam and nap wherever he wants and can come back to me if he wants. having him also helps a ton with routine - his waking up, feeding, playing, napping, and cleaning their supplies and making sure the house is clean so he doesn't accidentally eat something he's not supposed to. he's also such a crazy, cuddly guy, my family and i have really grown to love him and his antics

make sure both you and your partner are on the same page about sharing responsibilities, and whether you can handle the next 10-15 year commitment for a dog. you can sit down and list out your worries now while they're not actually happening, and come up with plans on how to actually tackle them - preparing for the literal worst"

Constant paranoia ,Anyone ever get neck pain on sides of neck?. I also feel tired all the time but one thing really.bad lately is like chronic breathlessness. I swear I don't take satisfying clear deep breaths in through my nose  anymore. Getting referred for some tests wirh GP in couple weeks fearing worst that I have heart failure. Grandad/Mum have/had heart issues too so I'm shitting myself but maybe I'm just worn out and exhausted we will see with the tests. Scared to be honest,Re. Neck pain- Yes from muscle tension. Your symptoms could be caused by anxiety or a medical reason. See what the tests show. Keep strong and patient. Take good care of yourself.
i feel like i’m going crazy ,"just had a 2 am crying session before mentally composing myself to seek advice 😮‍💨 but anyways recently, i’ve been having a lot of issues which i 90% believe is due to anxiety. ever since i’ve been a little kid, i’ve had a bunch of stomach aches due to anxiety - it’s gotten a whole lot better since i’ve matured, but recently i feel like it’s coming back, and 10x worse. because of my trauma as a child, i have really bad emetophobia + health anxiety. recently i had a bad experience with a drink that gave me a really bad acid reflux. i tried to play it off and go to school the next day, but that was a horrible decision and i immediately had to call somebody to pick me up after my first period because my symptoms returned. the first thing i noticed was the second i arrived home, it was like all my symptoms were erased and i felt at ease. i stayed home for 2 days after that, and things were going great/i didn’t feel bad. the next day, the moment i enter school i start feeling dread and tears. i feel my emotions fluctuating and i even fear eating food. i force myself to eat something light and soft, but then my mind starts thinking about the worse situations. i find myself feeling that same acid reflux feeling and ofc my emetophobia makes things worse :( now here i am feeling the same exact thing (even after not eating anything) bc of my horrible brain that likes to overthink. the second i listen to calming music, it gets better, but unfortunately i won’t be able to do that all the time in school / other situations. i don’t know how i’ll be able to get through days of school without causing myself pain, and the worse thing is that exams are near/this year’s grades are the most important. i hate myself for causing my own body pain. i have so much events soon and things i’m looking forward too, but knowing that my own brain is sabotaging me has me in tears. the fact that anxiety is a taboo topic in my family doesn’t help either 🫠",Get to the doctor. Get some therapy. It will get better. Keep strong.
Sleep and more sleep,I told my PCP my anxiety has gotten worse she put me on Ativan all I do is literally sleep! So I have to choose between debilitating anxiety or constantly sleeping... I must say I do feel better after sleeping for the past 2 days. ,"Shit, sounds like a fucking vacation."

Throwing up isn’t bad at all, just think of it as something cleansing so you can relax and drink some water after you throw up so you don’t dehydrate yourself. It’s fine 💛"

Do the next round like you don’t care about it or just force it to happen yourself by being at the sink, it will make you comfortable with doing it. And after it’s done just see if you still feel sick and check with a doctor, It’s fine to have your stomach do that so many times over even after you threw up many times."

Am I being an anxious hypochondriac or should I see a doctor?,"Hi. I (f21) have recently been experiencing pain in my chest/ heart region on my body and it has been going on for a week. It feels like a sharp pain sometimes and tightness but it goes away as quickly as it comes. It is pretty frequent too and it’s starting to concern me. I was just gonna wait it out a bit longer but tonight my left arm started aching really bad and now that won’t stop. 

Is my anxiety around my health causing me to feel this pain or should I see a doctor? For reference, I am a really anxious person and I think it’s a serious problem. I am afraid of dying and I think whenever I feel any pain i get really scared, but this has been going on for a bit. Any advice? ","It’s entirely possible that it’s just anxiety, but you should still get it checked out for your own peace of mind. By a regular doctor, not the ER."

I had an anxiety attack a few weeks ago where I started having chest pain but it wasn’t what I’d consider bad. 
 
That being said - try some calming techniques,
Have you taken anything for the pain like ibuprofen? Muscle pain from anxiety can happen because of clenching and stiffness. I personally have found that when I’m having heart anxiety I notice pains more especially on my left because my mind knows that’s a heart attack symptom so I’m hyper aware when in reality I’m just aging"

Go see your doctor for your own peace of mind and  get checked out remember even if they find something like a slightly irregular heart beat that is ok and lots of people have it and live their lives normally it isn’t something that will harm you in your day to day life."

Let me put your mind at ease. You’re 21 years old so the chances of you having a heart attack is very low with the exception of genetics and abusing recreational drugs.  Second, a heart attack is a pain around your chest, neck, shoulders and it gets progressively worse.  You would know if you are having a heart attack. It’s like an elephant sitting on your chest.  I would recommend going to a cardiologist and getting a full work up, EKG, stress test, etc.  once he or she gives you peace of mind take it.  🙏🏼"

My cousin has this problem worse than me and it's when he isn't even drinking. The weird part is he loves playing his drums really loud, but he admitted sometimes he has to stop just because it is affecting him so much."

I’m just so sad all the time,"Tbh I don’t know if what I feel is only anxiety or some combination of anxiety and smn else but yeah
I am just so anxious all the time and I don’t even specifically know over what, I am always worried that I’m gonna mess up the one or two good things I have going on for me.
I used to think I have high self esteem, well atleast I never thought mine was low but I’ve come to realise recently that I like myself but I don’t love myself at all. I have absolutely 0 trust in myself.
It exhausts me just to exist smtimes and I didn’t even realise it, like all my energy just goes in being normal that I don’t think I ever have the energy to be fun to be around
I love being around my two frnds in clg but I think I put so much pressure on myself in regards to the frndship because I feel like if I were to mess that up I’ll have nothing in my life, I know it’s so unfair of me to put them on a pedestal like that but I can’t seem to not do that.
Going to therapy isn’t an option for me cause my college is super secluded and tbh I don’t think therapy is for me, I would just prefer to talk to my  frnds about what’s happening to me.
Smtimes I don’t know how to put all of this into words even and it just comes out as me crying about nothing and I feel like I’ve done that enough times.
I’m always stressed about my frndships, I get so scared ( idk what emotion that is per say) whenever we have the smallest disagreement to the point where I cannot breathe, I end up making it worse by not being able to deal with any amount of “issues” in our frndship,which makes me feel like I don’t let them tell me the problems they have with me when i actually would prefer if they told me cause i know keeping it inside will just end up making it worse.
I’m always in my head and I fucking hate it and I hate myself so much because of that.
I’m 20 and I cry over like every small thing, i know it might sound like crap but I actually actively try not to but my chest starts hurting and tears start falling.
I am in college and I feel like I want to go home but I never really feel better at home, I feel so uneasy all the time and no place really feels like home to me and that’s no one’s fault but my own

I have good weeks sometimes that might even be a month but when I start having bad days, it gets really bad. I’ve never really thought of killing myself but I have 0 will to live at the same time
I’ve just always hoped to die young.

So idk what exactly it is that I should do, I just really need a long hug and advice.
I just want to feel okay for a day or smthing but thanks for reading to whomever has read this",Go see a doctor and get some therapy. Take care of yourself. Baby steps are still steps.
Sleep deprived,"I’ve recently moved into my girlfriends house who has a 1 year old son, my sleeps been broken with being woken up a few times in the night multiple nights in a row, yesterday I got a tension headache and was having some food with her, I then saw a piece of food (sausage) went back to eat it and it wasn’t there, I was adamant about it and my girlfriend told me she only saw one. 

Could this be caused by sleep deprivation? It’s made my anxiety go wild.","No, this is so normal I read about it a while ago. Parents can’t sleep normally at all with a newborn but all of them say it gets better overtime so don’t worry too much and kinda let happen, it’s okay to wake up multiple times if you don’t have work tomorrow, but use earplugs, it can help. If it doesn’t then take turns who will sleep away from the newborn, kind of like shifts I guess 🤷‍♂️"

One tip on bars, I often take breaks from alcohol and will grab a Diet Coke instead of alcohol when I go out with friends and bartenders almost always give it to me for free, this has been true in all types of bars from dive to fancy cocktail lounges.

I'm self employed on rideshare and I don't have any colleagues. ,"That's a fair point, I know DC has a few dry bars so that's an option as well."
Brain tumor?,"Hello, I've developed very rough anxiety the last two months. I was getting dull headaches for a couple weeks then had a massive panic attack, and ever since then I've had brain fog daily, can't focus, and the pressure headache has moved to the back of my head but it is persistent all day. In the last two months there has never been a time where the headache hasn't been present. It isn't severe but it is pressure in the my head that isn't normal. The brain fog was really bad for awhile but lately has been a little better after I've been taking my anxiety medicine again but still is still relatively strong. Now im concerned I have a tumor. I had a head CT done and it was clear but I'm concerned they missed it. My PCP didn't even sound concerned with these symptoms but it's been months now and I don't feel normal. Even lately I've been experiencing really loud tinnitus all day and my memory hasn't been super great, and I get these weird flashes of pressure in the side of my head that last a couple seconds and also tingling in my head randomly and weird pressure when I'm eating. I figured these would improve with the medicine but it's been 4.5 weeks and I still don't really feel any better. Could it be a tumor? Or is the anxiety just so strong it needs time to go away? ","anxiety definitely causes physical symptoms, and you should definitely rule out serious things (which it sounds like you have with a CT), but there are soooooo many causes of pressure like headaches. i am very sensitive to barometric pressure shifts and extremes, and i also have inflammation from my deviated septum that spread to my ears causing pressure headache and buzzing/ringing in my ears. headaches are weird, if you’ve been to the doctor and they’re not concerned, you shouldn’t be overly concerned and do your best to stay comfortable, you could always try to get a second opinion. hopefully you start feeling better soon!"

Anxious/Avoidant Relationship… what do I do? I’m Anxiously Attached ,"I (21F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (22M) for almost 2.5 years, and lately, I’m feeling emotionally neglected. In the first year, everything felt amazing. He was emotionally affectionate, spontaneous with ""I love you""s, and even talked about our future together. We went on a trip, and everything felt like it was going in the right direction.

But over the past year, he’s become distant. I feel like I’m the one who has to initiate emotional affection, carrying our texting conversations, and bring up our future. Whenever I bring up my feelings or any concerns, he either shuts down or gives short responses. If I express that I miss the emotional connection we had in the beginning, he says things like ""I’m not comfortable with affection"" or ""It doesn’t feel natural to me."" Whenever I try to talk about when we will get married or have kids, he either gets annoyed bc of how much I bring it up and gives minimal responses, saying he doesn’t know where he’ll be in a few years. I bring it up a lot because he’s never given me a clear answer. 

He apologizes when I bring up how I feel, but his actions never change. It’s like we’re stuck in a pattern where nothing ever gets better. I’ve tried to be patient, but I can’t help but feel like I’m the one putting in all the emotional work. I have an anxious attachment style, so I need reassurance, but it feels like every time I bring it up, he pulls away even more. Is this relationship worth salvaging, or am I just wasting my time? How do I know if it’s a sign of an anxious-avoidant dynamic? 

TL;DR I (21F) have been with my boyfriend (22M) for 2.5 years. In the beginning, he was emotionally affectionate and initiated conversations about our future. Lately, though, he’s become emotionally distant. He no longer initiates affection or conversations about our future, and when I bring up my concerns, he shuts down or gives short responses. I feel like I’m the one putting in the emotional effort. I’m unsure if I’m overreacting or if this emotional distance is a dealbreaker. What should I do?",Talk to your boyfriend. See a therapist. Sort out your anxiety before it impacts your relationship.
Anxiety wins! ,"Imagine feeling constantly on edge, being stuck in ""fight or flight"" mode all the time.That's anxiety.Simple tasks become overwhelming. You wake up tense, unable to move, dreading the day's interactions it's like even doing simple life is hard.Social situations are minefields, filled with the fear of anxiety exploding and the shame of knowing it's irrational.You fight to control it, but the panic wins. It's a war between your mind and body, It's like your mind knows better that it shouldn't be happening, fully aware things are ok, but your body refuses to listen, stubbornly screaming danger!The feeling of being helpless erupts, turning into embarsassement because you can see everyone judging you as weak or freak ; their confused looks like they're asking ""what's wrong with you"".You feel like a burden, hiding your struggle to protect others from your anxiety.There's guilt when someone shows understanding, feeling they shouldn't have to deal with it.Anxiety is a relentless cycle of fear, self-doubt, and isolation.It becomes a loop with no escape, a constant battle within your mind and emotions.You fight to function and appear well, hiding your struggles.Dealing with anxiety is undeniably difficult.",Yep. Anxiety sucks but it can be controlled. Keep taking care of yourself and telling yourself the danger does not exist. Stay strong.
Constant Body Aches ,Can anxiety or stress cause constant body aches? Do any of you have or had this ? It’s driving me crazy.. I shouldn’t always be weak and body aches even when not sick.. ,Thats me right now. 😭

My med makes me sick,Prozac i swear irritates the hell out of my esophagus and makes me so nauseous. Anyone else? This can last up to a few hours after I take it ,Your digestive system uses serotonin. We take SSRIs (selective Seritonin reuptake inhibitors). So basically any time you take SSRIs the first thing it does is hit your digestive systems main functions. It can cause quite the upset. Usually when I start up SSRIs for the first time in a while I use some of my vacation time because I get SO SICK. After the first week my body readjusts itself and I’m fine. If your body is not loving this pill you could always try something else even if it’s a different SSRI I think they all have different methods. You could also go for a smaller dose

Fiancé in the ICU,"I brought my fiancé to the emergency room 16 days ago, they transferred him to another hospital and he has been in the ICU on life support since then.  I feel so anxious everyday that things are going to go the other way.  He's extremely sick and I tried convincing him to go for months but he refused until that day. I feel guilty.  I wish I could've done more,  but he kept refusing.  
I'm losing sleep and not eating much at the moment and I find it hard to do much else. ",Is he septic?

It's my belief that my mom knew she had breast cancer for months, yet didn't go see the doctor until it was too late because she just didn't like doctors.  I couldn't force her to go.  And if I'd argued with her, she still wouldn't have gone.

I'm sorry you're going through this and I hope he recovers.  But you have no culpability in this.  Please talk to a social worker at the hospital.  Regardless of him pulling through, you've likely got a lot of guilt and grief feelings, almost guaranteed misplaced.  Get in touch with someone who can help you through these.

can’t breathe and years of nasal congestion does not make it better,"21F here…

for the past like 1.5 years maybe a bit more I feel like I can’t properly breathe, it’s gotten much better compared to before but it hasn’t completely diminished. I think it started during the time I was diagnosed with Graves’ disease (autoimmune disease). My anxiety went sky high and I always felt like I wasn’t taking a full breath. Sighing or yawning makes me comfortable sometimes. I guess u can say Dyspnea. It doesn’t always happens. My nose has been congested for like over a year, I’ve seen an ENT, he said I don’t have a deviated septum but have some like nasal congestion like the turbines of my nose and that I can call to be put on surgery but he doesn’t recommend because it’s not guaranteed to go away forever (he tried to scare me and show me videos and say it’s so bad lol, but now I’m thinking of doing it). 

Anyways, I notice this more when I’m thinking too much, when I am home, etc. like whenever I go out (with friends, study at a cafe, etc) I feel fine. The moment I start settling at home or I’m not distracted I feel so shit. My anxiety is so bad sometimes it caused heart flutter last week, got a EKG done and it came back normal. I’ve had tests (breathing, x-rays) done before and they were fine they said. My doctor tried to recommend I seek a psychologist to help me with my breathing, maybe I breathe wrong too lol. I also have bad intrusive thoughts and that contributes to the anxiety 😬 so that’s def not helping :/

Anywayssss sorry for the yap. My minds been everywhere lately.  Does anyone else feel the same? ",The problem isn’t your nose it’s your anxiety. Get therapy. See your doctor about medication. If you want the surgery that’s your choice but it doesn’t sound that right call.

There’s also breath work or diaphragmatic breathing. 

There are medications. 

Don’t allow the anxiety to rule your life. Go out anyway. Go to work anyway. Learn to breathe through it. Practice. It might not stop it all but it will get better. 

Regular Exercise helps. 

I listen to podcasts . There’s a few for yoga Nidra. They help me sleep. There’s a podcast called Sleepy where a guy reads books. Lots of other podcasts to choose. 

Create a regular basic daily routine when you’re unwell. Get out of bed, hygiene, eat well, hydrate, regular sleep schedule, etc. 

Go to therapy. Learn about yourself. Get curious about it. 

Remember, you have been through several bouts by now right? Nothing bad happened. 

“Don’t Believe Everything You Think” is another good book. 

Just suggestions. 

Be good to yourself"

I had a bad high from taking too much THC: a cautionary tale,"Some background: I am a 23 yr old male and a newbie to consuming THC edibles. I'm relatively healthy, exercise frequently, eat mostly healthy, don't consume any other drugs, barely drink alcohol and haven't been diagnosed with any kind of anxiety or mental problems.

So here's the story. On Thanksgiving night 2024, I took 20mg of THC gummies and experienced a terrifying high. I purchased the gummies in Michigan back in July when I was visiting a friend for a few days and brought them back home. The gummies came in packs of 10 with each gummy being 10mg of THC. I had been taking them sparingly between July and now; really only using them when I was going out with friends or if I knew I wasn't going to be alone (with friends), and I was typically only taking one gummy at a time. All my experiences up to this point had been relatively pleasant and enjoyable.

Thanksgiving night rolls around. I eat dinner with my family, and afterward, I decide to chill in private in my bedroom to get high (they wouldn't approve of the THC usage lol). I take the first gummy around 6:50pm and start playing video games. Around 1.5 hrs go by and I'm not really feeling anything which I found to be a little unusual because I would usually start to feel something 45-60 mins in. I was getting a little impatient, and so naturally, I decide to have one of those *""these edibles ain't s\*\*\*""* moments and I take a second gummy around 8:20pm. It was a mistake. 100%.

About 15-20 mins after taking that second edible, I start to feel the high coming in. It's going great. I feel light, airy, silly, and relaxed. It was what I was looking for. I cannot recall exactly how long that feeling of bliss lasted, but it wasn't as long as the experience that would come, which turned out to be absolutely terrifying. I just remember that a certain point I started to become very anxious and my heart started pumping like crazy. I was breathing slow and heavy with my hands on my chest, pacing around my room trying to compensate for how fast my heart was beating. I tried so hard to keep myself calm, but it was also difficult to focus because I was high - duh. The anxiety only began to escalate because my heart was beating hard for several minutes and I was starting to worry that I was getting a heart attack. This is when I started to get terrified and I immediately wanted to get off this high train.

The intense heart rate gradually subsided after several minutes. I felt relieved and at ease. *Did I just survive a heart attack?* I thought to myself. I know it probably sounds so silly to read that, but I genuinely was unsure and I was scared. My heart had never beat like that before and for so long, so I didn't know what else to assume. I was scared that my heart was going to explode or give out. I started to regret taking that second gummy, especially 1.5 hrs apart from the first one - not knowing how long this hellish ride would last. (And just to clarify, I *wasn't* experiencing chest *pain*, my heart was just thumping very fast for long intervals and it was making me nervous). And unfortunately for me, that wasn't the end of things because that feeling of relief only lasted a couple minutes because those heart palpitations would come and go in waves.

So, I started to feel it again. My heart rate escalating. Constant deep breathing. It was just as intense as before. I began to worry for my life. I started to worry that I was going to die. I didn't know what to do. I wasn't sure if I should tough it out and hope it went away? Call 911? Call a friend? Tell my parents? Start telling people I love them? Start accepting that I am gonna die at a young age? I really didn't want to create a scene and scare my parents, but I was getting worried for my life. I had such a strong feeling of impending doom. Like it was going to be my last day of my life. *This was it. I'm going to die.* It truly was that scary. I was experiencing hell.

When the fourth wave of the heart palpitations started, I decided to just give in and tell my mom. I woke her and asked her to call 911 because I thought I was having a heart attack. I'll never forget that feeling of guilt and disappointment when I saw the fear in her eyes. I felt awful.

I'll spare the rest of the details from that night and just clarify that I am now fine (mostly) and that I no longer have those gummies. It's currently been two nights since that terrible high, and while I'm no longer high, I don't feel 100% back to my usual self. I don't know how to perfectly explain it, but I feel this lingering sense of anxiety and tightness in my chest and throat. I still feel a little bit of unease and I'm taking a break from exercising out of fear of increasing my heart rate again. I never want to feel like that again. In hindsight, now that I have some mental clarity, I assume I was experiencing my first ever anxiety/panic attack induced by taking too much THC. Not a heart attack. Regardless, it's a feeling I want to avoid ever experiencing again, and I've come to the conclusion that I no longer wish to partake in any form of marijuana again. I can live without it.

Sorry for the long post. It's my first one and I just had to get it off my chest. If you're anything like me and are a newbie to taking THC edibles, please please please just take it slow. I am not trying to be dramatic, but I promise you don't want to experience what I felt. I had never felt such genuine fear for my life. I wish I could undo it all. If you do decide to up your usual dose, don't be dumb like me and double it straight away. Go in smaller increments. And try to do it while in a safe space surrounded by people you trust. I wish I would've done that. Stay safe out there. <3","Long time stoner here. 
You should be fine. Most people have overdone it.  It was probably because you had a large meal beforehand that it took longer to come up.
If it ever happens again just keep telling yourself that you’ll be ok and it will pass . Easier said than done! Or if you have access to a Valium or some other benzo, that is the time to take one! 
I’ve never experienced really bad anxiety when getting too high but it can be unpleasant.  Another thing to do is just focus on one thing. Food is good , just go with the munchies and enjoy the sublime taste of foods. Or sex to be honest , masturbation on edibles can be amazing. The ln after you might just pass out in a pile of bliss. 
Golden rule one. Which you have worked out, don’t redose ! 
I had a situation back in my 20s when I made hash cookies and ate one before a family  reunion.  Drove there ( back before there was any laws about driving stoned 30 years ago ) and got hungry on  the way and ate a few more like an idiot. When I turned up I was mega stoned . Walked in the door, saw all these relatives I never see and waved and walked back to my car and drove off!  Just couldn’t do it lol! Went to a park in a forest and laid down under the trees for a few hours instead."
Is it ok to workout?,"I am having palpitations for the past 4 - 5 years ig. No blackout or chest pain or any other serious symptoms.

getting put on lexapro for the first time,"so starting tomorrow i have to take 5mg of lexapro a day for a week and then bump it up to 10mg and im a bit scared but kinda hopeful in a way

things im scared about:
being/feeling different 
the day ill have to get off of it
forgetting to take it
not having anxiety 

things im kinda hopeful for:
not having anxiety
not being scared to draw harder things (as an art student)
not being scared to paint
the weird vivid dreams people talk about 
not being scared to play off peaceful mode in minecraft
being able to make youtube videos using my own voice 
being able to make friends

i know most of the hopeful stuff is probably wishful thinking, but its a bunch of things ive been itching to do for years but my anxiety gets in the way of

i know some people lose their creativity while on this med, but as an animation major, im really hoping it could ease, or even change, the way i make my art. i have terrible line confidence because i get anxious, and i also avoid more complicated things because i get anxious and i tend to not finish things because i get anxious. i feel like eliminating that anxiety could really help with being able to push myself in new ways past my comfort zone (i already do, but moreso). im also hoping it could eliminate most of the mental breakdowns of things not going correctly 

oh and i hope i can make friends i kinda need some","Hello, in my experience taking lexapro (in my country it has diferent name, but google says it's the same), helped me to be alive again. The beginning was rough as the anxiety got worse, but that's normal side effect and it passed when I started taking full dose. It actually made me feel alive and I started to enjoy world again. I was a zombie before that. No impact on creativity, actually the opposite. Hope it will help you the same way."
Feeling guilty ,I don’t know how to explain this but i wake up everyday and just feel super guilty. I just feel like nothing i have in life is anything I actually deserve and i feel so guilty. i also feel so guilty for anything i might’ve done to hurt anyone in the past even though i can’t name anything specific i just feel extremely guilty. my parents have a house in Florida that they get rental income from and i invited my friends to go for a few days and they all said yes and we planned the trip but i just feel extremely guilty for even having the house and like i am such an asshole for taking my friends there. it feels like im a bad person all of the time and that i did nothing to deserve anything and that im mocking people who are less fortunate than me. i have literally felt constantly guilty ever since i was a kid but now that im 20 it seems to be the worst it’s ever been. when i was a kid my mom was very depressed and would regularly tell me of her plans to end her life and i also felt like it was my responsibility to keep my fathers drinking in check so i feel like these two things could be the reason why i feel so guilty all the time. idk maybe it’s like an extension of just feeling responsible for when everything takes a turn for the worse. anyways im sorry if this comes off as insensitive i just feel like i am a terrible person all the time for having opportunities i have and maybe hurting anyone in the past. i can’t tell if i am a horrible person or if its a delusion and i wanted to see if anyone else experiences this. ,Every individual bears a responsibility for their own life experiences. Sounds like you’re overestimating how much agency you have in other people’s lives. Disconnect from whatever role you perceive yourself having and focus on being the type of person that you would like to spend time with.
Does sometimes your anxiety about something that could happen being so hard to deal with that you almost wish it to happen ?,"First, sorry for my english, I don't often practice. 

Does sometimes your anxiety about something that could happen being so hard to deal with that you almost wish it to happen just to tell your brain ""you were right to be stressed about it !! Now can we calm down ???""

I know it's a bit violent but I think about It so much when I'm too much anxious about something... And I feel like It's kind of a self-destructive behavior. I mean...Your biggest source of anxiety is the end of the world, Ok, you can wish It to happen but you can't generate It, can't make It happen for real. But you're biggest anxiety is based on abandonment. You fear to death everyday that someone could left you for no reason. So It's so painful everyday to handle this thought that you begin to think about leaving the person first to stop your anxiety.

In my exemple, no reason to leave someone you love but the anxiety inside you tell you to do It to get better.  Do you know this guys ?

Do you think It's self destructive ?","I am currently experiencing this right now to an extreme. I have convinced myself my fiancee is going to call off our wedding with no evidence that it’s true. I think there is a lot of stuff going on on my end but a lot of it is just financial stress. Part of me just wishes he would call it off and break up with me so I can stop feeling like this. 

I am seeing my therapist on Tuesday but in the meantime have been practicing the mantra: “just because you think it, doesn’t mean it’s true.” It definitely has helped lessen my anxiety some."

Anxiety 24/7,"36 male I have anxiety from the time I wake up
Until I go to sleep. My anxiety centers around my chin/cheek/lip on right side of face that has felt weird/numb/loss of feeling the last 6 months. I feel and think about it from the second I wake up until the second I go to bed. My mouth/cheek/lip/cheek feel strange 24/7 and I obsess over it. The last week or so my jaw has felt weird on my right side and I feel like the inside of my mouth is sore. I got an MRI on my brain and it was clear and I also got blood work done that was normal. 

I’m thinking about getting on anxiety meds to see if it’s just all in my head. Anything to take my mind off my face. The doctor said
He was going to refer me to a neurologist but that was a month ago and I haven’t heard anything. ",Get some help. Go see a doctor and get therapy. Take care of yourself.
anyone else suffer with symptoms out of nowhere when they’re not even anxious? ,"racing thoughts, sweating, butterfly feeling in stomach, can’t focus or concentrate ?? i still get like this even though im on meds :/ i feel like im at a loss and like ill be stuck like this ","Yes you’re not alone.

Surprisingly I used to model and I stopped not too long ago but in some shoots I also felt the same way with a lot of people looking at me, my face would get stiff and I would have to stop my face from frowning. (I can’t control it sometimes.) I don’t know what this all is but it’s been a buildup for years and I don’t think I can take it anymore. Do you guys think this is some form of anxiety? If it is, I wouldn’t want to take medication, I already feel very numb and dissociated quite often. Do you guys have advice on how to handle something like this without it? ",Possibly. Speak to a doctor. If it is anxiety then see a therapist.
Not feeling the same since marijuanna high,"Hello people umm so a few months ago I got really high and started to panic umm this isn’t the first time this happened so I knew just to stay calm and try and go to sleep. But my thing is is that after the high I had a massive panic attack and then proceeded to panic a little more for maybe 5 minutes but before I was otp with a friend laughing and getting the munchies

Yet this also was a dealer who I bought from before but only twice and it never did me like this ( maybe because I smoked ALOT of it) It also came in like this pack with buds and smelled like weee and had “Super Lemon Cherry Gushers on it” I didn’t really notice anything different within me for about a week or so but weeks later I started noticing changes like I didn’t go out anymore as much, I kept asking myself if I was real, the world felt different in a sense sometimes still does tho I asked around and no one said they seen any real changes within me. I mean I can think I work my memory is great I can sleep good and all

Wha made me think the wee was either too strong or maybe it wasn’t weed or maybe it was laced was because like I said before I didn’t feel real , I started having negative thoughts though the thoughts I had weren’t a mother were just heightened like I couldn’t get rid of em
My anxiety went SKY HIGH like I mean panic attacks waking up from sleep nightmares, heart palpitations, numbness and tingling which these symptoms are all gon now but my vision has changed a bit though I can still see and I also wear glasses the eye floaters I would say are pretty much gon but static vision in dark
Places are still there as well as head tension

So if anyone has anything or tips or a similar situation could you give me a way to get to 100% is seen this thing called neuroplasticity but I don’t know wear to start so if anyone has any coping mechanisms if this doesn’t go away or if they have recovered COMPLETELY what did you do or know someone who else went through the same thing ","Literally went through the same, I smoked a joint and didn’t feel the same for like 7 months. Anxiety absolutely hell. Eye floaters, palpations, extreme anxiety, muscle spasms, no sleep and no eating and many more anxiety symptoms. I’m finally better now, but still suffer with anxiety and can’t smoke anymore"

I take Lexapro for anxiety. To feel better I had to be patient honestly and it was really hard. Overtime I just got better, but while I was struggling I changed my diet to a healthy diet, had a good support system, go to the gym, some therapy, breathing exercises, massages, and just trying to find things to occupy my mind.

Feeling anxious I’m just word dumping 😭 ,"I’m just word dumping because I’m anxious right now and I’ve never tried just typing things out. I started feeling sick earlier this year and was already a very heavy smoker. I’d get these random attacks of horrible horrible pain and vomiting that would last for over a day. 

I constantly went to the hospital this year for it with no help. They could only help alleviate the pain. Got diagnosed with panic disorder, gastroparesis, prolonged QT. Fun stuff. 

Leaving my house is so hard but I manage just for work. A lot of my friends don’t talk to me anymore because I was always the friend going out and about. Doctors kept mentioning hyperemesis but it’s literally the only thing that ever helped and kept helping. Well it was true and it caused a lot of my problems. 

Currently sitting here now in the bathroom scared of nothing with a regular stomach cramp that turned into a panic attack because the pain scares me so much any type of discomfort triggers my fight or flight lol. I stopped smoking and it’s been kinda hard ngl but I think I’ll be okay. 

Okay I feel a little better. Thanks for listening to my yearly review 😭 idk if this is against the rules feel free to take it down. I’m just posting it just to read little words of encouragement and advice if I get them. ",Glad you’re feeling better. Congrats on quitting smoking. That’s a great step in the right direction!

Get some help especially if this isn’t your only symptom.

Give it some time. After 2 weeks if it’s still happening consult with your doctor. Try the DARE app. It’s very good for panic attacks whether it’s day time or nocturnal.

high bpm?,"I've been super anxious these past two weeks because of a UTI, and my bpm has been constantly high. It only goes down when I'm relaxed (sometimes) or going to sleep.

","So I work closely with sepsis. You would have a lot
Of other symptoms. High fever, difficulty breathing, you would feel like absolute garbage. It’s always possible it was caught super early but for the most part it’s usually pretty obvious. Elevated HR is normal when fighting illness or many kinds. Sometimes people embellish stories and I’m not exactly saying that was the case but sepsis usually is intense 

Contact your doctor about your continues symptoms though it’s possible they could add or change antibiotics and even do other labs to
Rule out stuff like sepsis"

Question about alcohol bc I’m sobering up and no post I find directly answers my concern,"I just had a Christmas party with my uni friends. At some point of the night I sobered slightly and my heart rate was 112 ish consecutively for 45mins and my chest felt a little strained. But it went away. 

Then we played a drinking game and I got drunk again, and my heart rate is about 114-118 consecutively. It’s been about 30 mins since my last sip now. It’s not straining this time. I just want to know, is this a normal reaction to alcohol with untreated anxiety?

Elevated heart rate,"So I got over one anxiety and my brain has now decided I need to obsess about my heart. My thyroid levels are off and we’re fixing that which can cause increased anxiety and heart palpitations. 

That being said - I’m struggling. I’m in the midst of what I believe is a panic attack, maybe in the tail end of it but my heart rate won’t settle down for me to sleep. It’s consistently anywhere from low 80s to 110. I’m trying to stop checking it and sleep but I can’t stop feeling it to go to sleep. I’m trying to talk myself out of going to the hospital while everyone’s asleep because I’m pretty sure it’s anxiety but my brain whispers “what if it’s not”.  Had the shaking/chills but no fever which I usually get with an anxiety attack too

Just bummed and looking for people to relate
Etc
","I can super relate to this. Of all the anxiety symptoms, this one is the worst for me. Just feeling super aware of my heart beat while trying to go to sleep. Of course, it becomes a vicious cycle with the “what ifs” even though I KNOW it’s just anxiety. So frustrating. So scary. So exhausting.

Helps at least a little to know we’re not alone in it. 

For me, when i just can’t seem to fall asleep, sometimes listening to something can help  give my mind something else to focus on. Like an audio book, podcast, or guided meditation."
Freaking out about wisdom teeth growing.,"My lower right wisdom teeth is coming out and the pain is getting progressively worse, on the first day i felt some discomfort on the gum but that was about it, today my jaw hurts and my face is red and swollen.

I have read mixed stuff about this issue as some people say it is normal and that it shall pass, meanwhile others basically say that i have to go to the dentist asap if i don’t wanna die.

I have health anxiety and this is really freaking me out, i’m willing to go to a dentist and having this taken care of if needed obviously but i can’t go right now and i just want to know if i should go to the ER until i can go to the dentist or will i be ok until then?","My wisdom teeth started to grow in at a much later age than normal and they are still growing in now. I don't think they are going to fully grow in because I think they would have by now. I never noticed any discomfort from it. To put your mind at rest, it would probably be best to go to the dentist but I'm sure they will recommend taking them out. I personally think it's not an emergency situation at all and you will be perfectly fine until you can get to a dentist. I think you'll be fine even if you decided to let them grow in like I am. So maybe the fact that mine have been growing in for years and nothing has happened will put your mind at ease :)"

Shortness of breath ,"Does anyone else get shortness of breath?? I don’t really feel anxious but I’m having shortness of breath. I ve had blood work, ecgs etc and everything is fine. Does anyone get shortness of breath? Is that normal?","I have. Turns out I was taking clavicular/chest breaths instead of diaphragmatic/belly breaths. Diaphragmatic breaths are deeper, more replenishing, and we use that breathing when we are more relaxed and when we sleep. Clavicular breaths are short and shallow, so we take them more often and feel as though we aren’t breathing deeply.  Anxiety and stress promote clavicular breaths. It’s easy to change with breathing exercises/practice to break the chest breathing habit."

i guess non-anxious people don’t understand the thought process of health anxiety. ","It sounds like you're reassurance seeking by telling her about all your worries. She might know that reassurance seeking makes anxiety worse in the long run, and be frustrated that you are doing a behaviour that'll make you worse perhaps?

How old are you? Are you still a kid living with your mum or are you living away and calling her to tell her your symptoms? If the former, can you talk to her about getting yourself into some therapy for your health anxiety? It could help to talk to her about your anxiety in general not about your symptoms, but about how you plan to manage your anxiety and how she can help. With health anxiety, of course, talking about your symptoms doesn't tend to help your anxiety so maybe you could plan what she can do when you try to talk to her about them? She could perhaps help you remember that it's not helpful to reassurance seek, she could talk to you about therapy techniques you learn etc, things like that. Giving her something constructive that will help you get better might help her not be upset."

i guess non-anxious people don’t understand the thought process of health anxiety. ","You probably heard about it a lot when you were younger because it's a lot more prevalent to have your tonsills removed as a kid because the healing process is quicker and easier. The older you get, the less likely doctors will be to recommend a tonsillectomy because the recovery is harder on the body and takes longer. I have health anxiety too and I get tonsillitis probably 3-4 times a year and my doctor still doesn't think that I get it frequently enough to have them removed because of the difficult recovery. Worst case scenario is that your doctor will prescribe you antibiotics and it will be uncomfortable to swallow for a couple of days :)"
Numbness in sternum,"So today my sternum (middle bit between pecs) in my chest was numb or very heavily tingly. Definitely numb, wondering if anyone else has had this?",The more you focus the worse it will get. Focus on treating your anxiety.
Lingering anxiety? ,"Strange thing that I’ve noticed. I (21f), have never been diagnosed with anxiety but am almost positive that I exhibit symptoms of a clinical anxiety disorder, which would not be surprising considering my mother has been diagnosed with OCD/Anxiety, and has been taking medication for a while. Anyways, I’ve noticed that sometimes I will get a deep anxious feeling when I’m seemingly doing nothing stressful or unpleasant, and this occurs often, and it is always followed by a thought about a job I haven’t worked in years. 

I used to serve at BBW about 2 years ago and worked there for 3. But I have since had 2 different jobs and a lot has happened in my life. At the time, when I was working as a server there, the job was stressful but nothing that I thought would have a major impact on my life. But I have noticed 60% of the time that I start to feel anxious I have thoughts about serving at that restaurant. It just seems odd to me that I have not worked there in so long and it still is either the cause or a result of some of my anxiety. I also have only ever served as a job, and have served in multiple restaurants (still do) and the anxiety is never followed by thoughts of any of the other restaurants I’ve worked in, I love the serving job I work now. Does this ever happen to anyone else? ",Go see a doctor and treat your anxiety with medication or therapy. Or both!
Has anything helped your anxiety?,"This subreddit has helped me a lot but nowadays, it makes me worry about things I didn’t even know where possible. I know things are different for everyone but the great spectrum of anxiety and its debilitating symptoms is so frightening to me. 
With that being said, among all of the bad, is there anything that helps your anxiety and eases it? 
I’m hoping that there is positivity and that it does get better somehow. 
Thank you guys. ","I don’t feel cured - but do definitely feel like I’ve experienced progress over the past four months. When my anxiety feels its worst, it helps a lot to remind myself that I am overall making progress. 

Things that have helped include:

- eliminating caffeine and alcohol 
- drinking tons of tea and water
- protecting my sleep schedule 
- therapy
- trying to take a more proactive instead of reactive approach to the day
- breath work and mindfulness practices 
- supplements (valerian root and ashwagandha and magnesium)
- exposure 
- spending time with community. Trusted friends and family. 
- redirecting my thoughts with familiar shows or funny podcasts. 

Honestly there’s lots of complex stuff, but the basics are some of the most important things to focus on imo. Eating regular meals. Drinking tons of water (sometimes with electrolytes). Eliminate or limit sugar, alcohol, coffee. Protect your sleep schedule. 

And of course, at some level healing from anxiety will just require time.

But it’s still an ongoing journey for me. My baseline anxiety still varies quite a bit from day to day. Some days it feels like my anxiety is completely gone. The next day it’ll feel pretty present all day and focusing on anything else will be difficult."

I get such intense head pressure that it feels like my head is literally going to explode 🤯. Or I’m going to stroke out from it . Idk how to really explain it besides intense head pressure like tight and tense too almost like it’s full of something or stuffy idk. 

It’s to the point where the pressure has been so intense I have had to leave work from crying and feeling like I’m losing my mind. It makes you angry and want to bash your head against the wall. I wanted to go to er but I have before and the brain ct came  back normal and the migraine cocktail didn’t help too much if I remember correctly.

Thank you.","The most impactful book I've ever read is eat to beat anxiety and depression in six weeks, which is a book in the new field of nutritional psychology. I heard about it on a podcast. You know how all our lives experts say you need x number of cups of green leafy vegetables, x amount of fiber, x amount of certain types of proteins; it occurred to me that I had always looked to medicine or something external. The one thing that I had not done focused on eating in a way that I'm getting enough of what I need rather than just counting calories and carbs to get fit .

I started to feel different in just a week after following his advice. He makes the claim that much of our depression and anxiety symptoms, while it's definitely influenced by our genetics, the symptoms could be caused by simple malnutrition. 

His best advice for me was to eat like an explorer. Try and get the widest variety of nutrition tha you can in the meals and only supplement what you couldn't possibly get through those times. 

Don't get me wrong, its easier said than done. My experience was that the hardest week was the first and then it got a lot easier because my racing thoughts stopped and my anxiety response went way down.  It felt like it gave my brain the extra horsepower it needed to be able to throw through problems without the same amount of heightened negative emotions.  

I actually lost a ton of weight after staying on this and I wasn't even counting calories. You give your body just what it needs your appetite is a lot easier to control and your mind feels better.

The human brain at just under 2 lbs uses about a quarter of your caloric load in a day. Thoughts use energy. That nutrition helps your mind be more resilient. 

I wish you the best of luck. Remember it's only hard in the beginning and then it starts to give you back so much more that it gets easier."

What helped my anxiety recently that’s unrelated to food is setting time limits on some apps I would usually doom scroll on for hours… Just so it forces me to seek something to do elsewhere like reading, listening to music, cleaning, writing or just relaxing.

To come back to foods, bananas/oranges/eggs/yoghurt/chamomile or green tea for example are general safe foods that help with anxiety. I believe eggs help with iron intake and the others all do their own thing. Personally I love Greek yoghurt with honey and sliced banana. Where I live you can buy a cup that has vegetables, soup stock and herbs that you need to fry for a bit, add water, cook and then puree to a fresh vegetable soup which is healthy. Nuts are also good, cashews are nice. During the summer I grilled some fish in the oven and ate that with a salad which was great.

When I am anxious, I feel a heightened sense of awareness of what's going on in my body and I seem to notice things like my heart rate, my ability to take deep breaths, and the sensation of blood pumping into my limbs - where I otherwise wouldn't when my anxiety isn't feeling as elevated.

It is a viscious cycle when anxiety causes physical symptoms like heart palpitations, chest pain, nausea, anxiety poops, etc and then experiencing those symptoms causes even more anxiety. Personally, I found it helpful to do a small bit of research about why those things happen to my body when I am expereincing anxiety (for example - why and how anxiety can cause elevated heart rate and how and why it causes digestive issues). It really helped me to understand what was going on in my own body when I was experiencing a bout of anxiety because it helped me to feel less out of control about what was happening to me."

At a point i thought i had POTS but i dont think i do because i dont have all the symptoms. its just annoying because yes i had severe health anxiety i feel it getting better but the symptoms are still lingering. but does anyone get this ? also my heart beats a little bit faster after eating ? cardiophobia sucks i’ve had every test they all been normal just that fast heart rate maybe just extreme stress and anxiety idk,thank you 😊🙏🏾 i appreciate the advice i hope we both get over this
Anxiety ,"Hey wondering if someone could help me out! 
Here are my symptoms 

Heartburn so severe for the last few months. 
Burping 
Just recently I started experiencing upper left side chest pain right under my left breast and it all over left side sometimes with burning too 
I'm always fatigued and feel dizzy and faint like I'm about to pass out but I don't and I have lost so much weight in such a short period of time what could this be? Just anxiety? 
Saw a cardiologist heart is fine. ",Also racing heart a lot !

Saw a cardiologist heart is fine. ","I have suffered of the sameish symptoms for past 2 years. I feel pain especially on the upper left side of my stomach. It usually passes and turns out as being trapped gas. But i cant help but feel like i am gonna gie. Whenever i feel something weird my mind jumps to worst conclusion and makes it worse.

Im honestly getting tired of feeling like this all the time. I have countless doctors visits but nothing has been found. I did notice that most of my bloating went away with going glutein free diet. And before anyone asks I had tests done I am not allergic to glutein.

All I can say is sleeping more helps but I also suffer from insomnia due to the symptoms. So best of luck try to find what helps you sleep it truly does help."

Made a mistake at work and feeling very anxious ,"Just wondering how people cope with making mistakes at work. I’ve just realised I made a bit of a stupid mistake and I’ll have to deal with it on Monday. It’s not a mistake that is going to have serious consequences as I caught it in time, but it’s probably enough to annoy my superiors and I’ll have to explain how it happened. And the basic answer to that is I didn’t check something properly. I do have the excuse that it was due to a not very user friendly system but at the end of the day I could’ve been more alert and checked properly. I’m just terrified of being told off by my superiors. And I’ll look like a complete idiot.

In my defence over the last year or so I’ve been very exhausted, most likely from stress caused by both work but also private things, which has definitely affected my alertness levels and left me more prone to errors. But I can’t really say that to them. I’ll just be the office idiot on Monday.

My problem is my anxiety about it is going through the roof and I’m not sure how I’m going to sleep before Monday morning. Any tips on how I can calm myself down?","I know this feeling and have been through it several times. It’s hard to admit it, but you caught it and are going to take the steps to correct it and that is a plan of action that is responsible and something your supervisors would probably admire rather than trying to hide it. 

I would remind myself that Everyone of us makes mistakes. Your supervisors have made mistakes too. Humans make errors and then they try to make them right. You got this, and remember that whatever you are catastrophizing in your head probably won’t happen and it most likely won’t be as big of a deal to others as it has been to you. Sending you peace."
Anxiety meds for health anxiety?,"I have been dealing with moderate health anxiety for over 6 months now and while I think some environmental factors have helped a little bit I feel like the anxiety has dug its claws in. I have noticed new fear and negative thoughts coming up when I used to never think that way before, so I feel like medication would help with that increasing trend of anxiety. However, I can’t get over the fear of symptoms from the medication and I don’t like the idea of not being able to just stop a medication if it is making me feel bad. I’m also worried about the possibility of weight gain and sexual issues often associated with SSRIs. If anyone has any suggestions or experience with meds that helped health anxiety I would love to know. ",Propanolol is used off label for anxiety and is very safe unless you deal with low blood pressure and you can stop anytime without withdrawal because it's nonaddictive

Rolling panic attacks,"I’ve suffered from anxiety for over a decade and sporadically have panic attacks. Last night I had one that was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. 

It started with my face feeling very hot. Pretty normal symptom. For a few hours before bed I felt anxious but not sure why. I went to bed and woke up after about 90 minutes in a full blown attack. My whole body felt on fire but it felt like ice in my veins. My skin felt like it was going to split open. I couldn’t stay laying down, I had to pace. My heart felt like it would pound right out of my chest. After 45 minutes, I started getting dressed and woke my husband. I needed to go to the hospital because I thought something else had to be happening. Trying to explain to him what was going on, I began sobbing uncontrollably, and then hyperventilating. Then the dry heaving started. Oddly enough, the dry heaving kind of snapped me out of it.  I took a clonazepam and laid down, but it was a few more hours before I fell asleep.

Upon waking, I felt good. But within 30 minutes, that awful flushed feeling and panic rising in my chest started again. I took another clonazepam after about an hour of fighting symptoms and felt okay for several hours.

Now at 7pm, it’s starting all up again. I keep trying to remind myself that if it were a true medical emergency, I wouldn’t have hours of feeling fine in between. But it’s still so hard not to ruminate and convince yourself it has to be something else because panic attacks shouldn’t last this long.

I have an appointment with my doctor on Monday but I’m still wondering if I should get checked out. Of course I’m concerned it’s a heart attack, although I have no chest pain.

I hate this so much.",The anxiety and panic attacks  with crying spells are killing  me Was out walking with my wife when it hit I made the mistake  of taking  a losartan bp med instead of my metroprol succanate  which wast lowering my bp so my GPA prescribed the losartan  My up and down bp is another issue  Anyone else suffering with this also How are you handling it Was prescribed hydroxyzine  but took it once before bed and the next day I was groggy and out of it

I hate this so much.","I had one like this. I have multiple attacks a day and always run to the ER thinking that the next will make my heart stop. I was doing okay for a few months when suddenly I felt strange and my face felt hot. Suddenly my heart was beating 220 bpm and I tried to drive to the ER but stopped and called an ambulance. I remained relatively calm so I started thinking it wasn't a panic attack. When the ambulance got there it had gone away and I was just shaking. 


I had my HR stuck at 175 for almost an hour and convinced I was going to die bc I've always read that panic attacks only last 20-30 min but they've never found anything wrong with me. 


 If it would make you feel comfortable I'd see a cardiologist. It didn't help me lol but it might help you. Rolling panic attacks are the worst and unfortunately it's caused by the subconscious fear that you are going to have another one even when you aren't thinking about it."

I am diagnosed with GAD, OCD, and Depression.

I want a family and to just be happy but I don’t know if I’ll make it that far. ","I am so sorry you’re feeling this way. This happens to me, & I am on Prozac (depression) + take 1-1.5mg of Clonazepam at night since the half-life is longer than other ‘sleep aids’ I’ve been on. Despite it being a benzo, it calms me down especially in the mornings when anxiety hits me hard. Maybe ask psychiatrist about that? I’ve tried many meds for a while, & without being ‘overly medicated’ this works for me mostly. 

I have a therapist weekly & I use apps like Headway but it’s a full-time job. Hang in there. 🙏"

I want a family and to just be happy but I don’t know if I’ll make it that far. ","I'm sorry to hear about the overwhelming struggles you're facing right now.  Feeling stuck, like you're battling your own mind, can be incredibly difficult.  It's clear you've been trying to find solutions, and it's courageous to reach out and express what you're going through.

I recently read an article that might provide some comfort and practical insights for what you're experiencing.  It's called ""[Anxiety in Men—Bible Help for Dealing with Anxiety](https://www.jw.org/en/library/series/more-topics/anxiety-in-men/)"", and it discusses how anxiety and depression can feel all-consuming but also how understanding these challenges and finding supportive strategies can make a difference.  

I know you've said you don't want to burden your loved ones, but sometimes just sharing your thoughts with someone who cares can ease the weight you're carrying.  You're not a burden-you're someone they love and want to see happy.

You've taken a brave step by expressing your struggles here, and that shows strength and a desire to move forward.  Don't give up."

Anyone else,I’m pretty good at speaking (as in articulate and clear) but I’m terrible at relationships because I’m too scared of annoying people or being too clingy.,I’m just terrible at speaking articulately tbh. About 3 years ago I became self conscious about my voice because I’m British and I would play video games with American people and they would always mock me . I’m northern English so my accent is different to the typical British accents Americans seem to know . But I convinced myself that there was something wrong with me and I became severely obsessed with how I talk and i literally forgot how to talk normally and would force my voice to be deeper . Messed me up mentally and tbh even now when I’m talking I kept breathless and a shaky voice and random voice cracks it’s mad 🤣
2nd emergency room visit in 2 weeks...,"Greetings,

Well, the past few days have been absolute hell with anxiety, panic, and dp/dr. I woke up feeling so detached from everything this morning and didn't want to get out of bed. I began crying hysterically like I did the night before so the decision was made to bring me to the behavioral health emergency department. Speaking to the MD, he told me I definitely have textbook GAD and also panic disorder. He said that I needed to give Effexor (75 mg which I was previously given 2 weeks ago) a few more weeks to fully kick in and Ativan to help alleviate bad anxiety symptoms when they arise. On top of the Ativan, he prescribed me propranolol, a beta block. to assist in alleviating symptoms. He didn't want to commit me because I wasn't a threat to myself or others Thank full for his honesty. 

Wanted to get y'all's insight on how to cope with the anxiety in the meantime or any tips to help.

Stay blessed",Ativan can work%100 you are okey
Idk how to be okay these days,"I’m struggling so badly and I’m not being present. I can’t talk to anyone cuz you know when mental health hits you it hits you… everything feels so overwhelming and you can’t do anything. :( 
Please tell me what to do.. I can’t get myself to study and I know I should but I’m just stuck in fight or flight mode. And everytime I say okay let me smoke a cig so I can start and I end up really just sitting on my bed. I don’t feel like doing anything. And I think I feel numb :/","Nicotine just scrambles my brain and makes me feel more lost. I recommend finishing what you got or throwing it away. The second you have it in arms reach you will grab it just like any other addictive substance. 

When you feel overwhelmed or frustrated go for a walk do pushups or talk to someone. 

And thirdly focus on purpose. I don’t think this gets discovered overnight but keep at it. Imagine the life you want and are working for to motivate you to do the work. If you don’t want long term thoughts focus on small rewards at the end of the day after finishing your work. Best of luck!"
"HELP, it feels like there is a hole in my head and I can’t feel the left side of my body. I struggle with really bad anxiety. ","I struggle with really bad anxiety and have been very paranoid about getting schizophrenia or like hallucinations. My grandma had schizophrenia , bipolar and paranoia.  The difference with me is that I know what I’m paranoid about isn’t real and isn’t possible. I feel like I’ve been so focused on getting schizophrenia and paranoia that I’m starting to believe I have it. And now I’m scared because it feels like there is a hole and pressure on my left side and it’s slowly migrating. 

",Do you think the feeling is caused by your anxiety itself? I find that for my symptoms’ root cause is the anxiety itself :(

The only way society tries to fix mental illness is with therapy and medications. All but the most left leaning politicians don't care about shortening the work week. They just want us to eat more pills and work longer hours even if the pills don't work and the work destroys our bodies and minds. It feels hopeless sometimes. 

The best thing you can do is to work really hard on handling your anxiety and choose work carefully, and if you are able, cut down hours. Maybe think about changing your job."

Anyone else relate ?,"I was deeply depressed for not finding a job. Then I found a job and now I feel anxiety every - goddamn - day. I feel like is a miracle when I have a normal, functional day. I have constant anxiety bc I always feel like I am not good enough, that I will fuck something up and that I am a failure. The thing is that I don’t even care about the job *that much*; is just that I don’t want to be a failure and make mistakes.

It makes my life very difficult.

The problem that accentuates my anxiety is that I have no support system. I have no family here, no friends, no ppl to spend time with. And so all I do is hyper focus on what mistakes I *might* do at work and how to prevent them. 

I have always been anxious regarding work, school, places where I have to prove myself. But I don’t remember it being this bad, as it is now. 

I am very jealous of ppl who really don’t give a fuck and just have their days, good, bad, and just move past them. If I make a mistake at work, a small one, I get so obsessed with it and feel so much guilt, and then I remember others ppl’s mistakes, bigger than mine, and I get so jealous on how easily they move past them. 

I HATE my anxiety so so so much. So much."

Wobbly knees? Anyone feel like they won't be able to walk properly?,"I have wobbly knees/legs for more than a month. I walk while holding my feet coz i feel like i will fall and my legs will stop working suddenly. It's really getting to me.

I’ve been having all kinds of symptoms, including the occasional weak leg. Finally got my bloodwork done, and my vitamin D level was critically low. If you Google “vitamin D deficiency Reddit”, there are people talking about all kinds of symptoms. I only just found this out yesterday so it’s fresh on my mind, but it’s worth a shot.

Sometimes my knees make popping sound, I'm just 25 and it's really deteriorating my mental health ","Instabilities happen; there is an ""iceberg"" - if you start researching, it will take weeks to see the tip.

But remember that you were a kid once; you couldn't walk correctly for some time.  Every day was a workout.  You got stable, you got on a railway (basically made of school desks, tennis-shoed walks, mattresses, and if you're like me, lots of easy-chairs and computer mice/trackballs) and were escorted here.  Now, every day is a workout again.  You'll find new weak points, and the game will shift.  With bad luck or bad diet, joints and other connective tissue will go bad even if you play the game well.

Learn how to take a fall and do a little 'animal flow' type stuff to see how that feels; check yourself out in the mirror practicing various mobility goals like tying shoes, third-world squat, and leaping like an antelope while flailing your arms but suddenly landing in a graceful interpretive dance representing the first splash of water on a small - cherished, but no longer useful - campfire.

(this help is brought to you by cannabis)

But it really is about the squat - or things related to it; kettlebell stuff, some centered and some not.  Weighted carries.  Deadhangs, dips... It's pretty endless.  Honestly, dance is an invaluable window.  Probably kung fu, too; certainly basics like horse stance.  There are ""soft"" martial arts, of course.  I mean; I think some would consider tai chi to be kung fu.  You want to be able to hit those weird angles - and quick would be a good sign, too.  How you get there is multifaceted.

I don't know what I'm talking about but I've seen physical therapists on youtube who do.

But, you know; I'm just opining on some orthopedic stuff... you asked in r/anxiety, and there are plenty of reasons anxiety could be causing weakness.  It's even harder to know where to start with physiology; maybe start reading about dysautonomia and the autonomic system - but I just wanted to say that stuff about the physical stuff, because it is on my mind lately.  It causes dementia sometimes, they think - especially if it is mostly on one side of the body."

Get some magnesium l-threonate (Double Wood brand to be safe) and take two doses the first day.  If you don't feel it, this is the last time you need to spend 30 bucks on it.  Once you've performed this test, add any brand of magnesium complex and take both daily.

Also aggressively support potassium.  Lots of fresh food has potassium - meat and salad does.  But use the half and half salt, and consider adding straight potassium chloride to water - or there are other ways.  Gluconate I think maybe.  Don't avoid sodium; avoid crappy food though - if it has a lot of sodium, check if there is a hidden reason it is also crappy.

You should shotgun-spray random B vitamins at the problem.  The wrong one could make it worse, but you're in the shit anyway.  Try the ones you can't find in your diet.

It could be about half of the vitamins and minerals; I want to say more likely a deficiency than a surfeit with the way modern food goes, but who knows...

If I was a fake doctor and I was just trying to get rid of you I'd say you probably lost some species of bacteria, at least in some part of your gut, and you're withdrawing from a drug it made or something.  Aha!  But then you'd know I was fake, because I offered you an explanation."

Is my anxiety bad? Or am I exaggerating it? Idk. ","I went on a spiritual journey re-evaluating the perspectives I had about life. I constantly experimented with exposure therapy concepts without the help of therapists ( I had been in therapy for 7 years with no real relief), I did a lot of meditation, self reflection, journaling, exercise, radical acceptance stuff, change my diet, stopped giving away control through negative reactions. I tested midnfullness, PMR, Alpha Stim, Tens Units, suanas, ice dips, wilderness retreats, survival training, primitive skills, I even reconstructed what I believe to be the primitive human mindset. After four years of testing on myself like a human guinea pig, getting off meds and leaving therapy behind I found the right framework for natural anxiety management. And it actually worked. I’ve been anxiety and panic disorder free for over 4 years now. I used to think recovery was impossible and I was in a really dark place at the end of that 7 year period. But after all that hard work I did it. That’s generally the overview of how I did it."
Can’t tell if I have actual physical symptoms of if they’re caused by anxiety / health anxiety?,"I never had health anxiety until I moved back in with my family for a year. I have just moved back out, but being around my dad who panics over the smallest of physical symptoms, has really affected me.

For example, my ankle hurts from time to time. I told my dad this and he said it sounded like a blood clot and I needed to see a GP ASAP. Of course I panicked and saw one, they said vitamin D deficiency. It keeps coming back however, and recently I was given folic acid tablets too. I don’t know the underlying cause.

I currently have two infected toes. I have gone through two rounds of antibiotics but I don’t know if they’re healing. My mind immediately jumps to sepsis and I keep thinking I’m going to die and no one will notice in time and help me. I think this fear stems from when I had severe abdominal pain a few years ago. I called my dad to ask him to take me to dr as I couldn’t drive. He was off work but said he was busy as he had to take a shower. Mind you the drs had asked me to go in ASAP believing it was appendicitis. Since then I am really afraid of ending up really unwell but nobody helps me if I need it. 

I know these fears are irrational but I can’t shake them. I have signed up for therapy but the wait for that is months. I have generalised anxiety but after these incidents I seem to have heath anxiety too. I can rationalise that I’m being silly but I can’t stop the worry.

I get symptoms every now and again that could be anxiety, but I don’t know if they are. Things like chest pain. I have seen a GP about my chest pain and they think it’s costochondritis. If I think about a symptom I can feel it. This makes me worry that I will assume a real symptom is just anxiety and then I will miss something major.

In addition to this, my dr believes I am autistic. One thing I struggle with is common with autistic people apparently, the ability to identify pain levels and so on within my body. This also worries me and makes me think I will either miss something major or I will embarrass myself by panicking and it being nothing. I can’t seem to find a balance.

Just now I have pain in my toe from them being infected. I am worried the bone has become infected because I read that that can happen. But I don’t know if my toe hurts from something actually happening or if it’s hurting because I’m worrying the bones infected! It’s very difficult.","Hello, I used to have extreme health anxiety. This sounds like me in the past. 

Lots of physical symptoms can be caused by anxiety. I used to have so many of them. 

I wanted to say how it's critical you stop checking your symptoms, googling, maybe asking people or just any kind of reassurance seeking behavior. That's what this is all about. You will be also told that in therapy, so you might aswell start now. But I understand it's far easier said than done. Also since it's that bad, you might need medication, too."

I have stopped googling things (another learned behaviour from my dad), but I do seem to panic over physical symptoms.

For the past year of living with my parents, I have had my dad constantly telling me life is short, talking about death, and saying I am wasting my life because I am introverted. I think this has massively contributed to my health worries. It’s done a number on me hearing every day that life is short and we can die at any moment, it’s not really nice. I never really worried about it before this. 

I am doing slightly better than I was believe it or not and I can calm myself down quickly but the thoughts are still there. It’s quite dreadful. How did you get over this?"

Such statements can affect you if you start engaging in any reasoning as a result. As this is not just from what you go through, but from behavior or thoughts you start engaging in as a result of it. So for example if you because of the life is short statements start lets say counting how many years you might have left, that would deepen your anxiety from long term perspective. Or if you'd try to reassure yourself you still have plenty of years left, that would be bad, too. The point is to never do what anxiety makes you want to do. 

I got over it with medication and abstaining from all of this behavior like what I described. But mostly it was stopping with constant checking my ""symptoms"" and also stopping with avoiding triggers."

I have already been working on some of the things you describe over the past month or so, and I will say I have started to get a bit better as a result. I worry about not worrying enough about health issues, it’s honestly ridiculous. 

I tried not to engage with my dad’s ’death is always looming’ speeches but as he is my dad my default has always been to trust what he says. This has been incredibly damaging to me and I was in a good place mentally from therapy before I lived back with them and started experiencing this, and also had him telling me I ‘don’t try’ and I ‘waste my life’ etc (both statements aren’t true). I have also been called a disappointment etc which has really affected my self confidence which seems to make my anxiety worse.

I have moved out now so I think that is helping me to heal, but the damage is still there. Thanks for the advice man, wishing you all the best"

My mind immediately jumps to sepsis and I keep thinking I’m going to die and no one will notice in time and help me. I think this fear stems from when I had severe abdominal pain a few years ago. I called my dad to ask him to take me to dr as I couldn’t drive. He was off work but said he was busy as he had to take a shower. Mind you the drs had asked me to go in ASAP believing it was appendicitis. Since then I am really afraid of ending up really unwell but nobody helps me if I need it. 

I know these fears are irrational but I can’t shake them. I have signed up for therapy but the wait for that is months. I have generalised anxiety but after these incidents I seem to have heath anxiety too. I can rationalise that I’m being silly but I can’t stop the worry.

I get symptoms every now and again that could be anxiety, but I don’t know if they are. Things like chest pain. I have seen a GP about my chest pain and they think it’s costochondritis. If I think about a symptom I can feel it. This makes me worry that I will assume a real symptom is just anxiety and then I will miss something major.

In addition to this, my dr believes I am autistic. One thing I struggle with is common with autistic people apparently, the ability to identify pain levels and so on within my body. This also worries me and makes me think I will either miss something major or I will embarrass myself by panicking and it being nothing. I can’t seem to find a balance.

Just now I have pain in my toe from them being infected. I am worried the bone has become infected because I read that that can happen. But I don’t know if my toe hurts from something actually happening or if it’s hurting because I’m worrying the bones infected! It’s very difficult.","Oh, it sounds like what your dad has been saying was quite insensitive. Sorry about that. 

I forgot one important DBT technique that helped me, radical acceptance. Meaning whenever you're worried about something, you just tell yourself how it might indeed happen or might be true. It goes for even the most terrible scenarios that could result in death. And add how it's fine if it happens, with the sort of ""whatever"" sarcastic tone in your head. For example ""Yeah maybe I'll die. So what?"" like that. The way it works is, it's as if your anxiety is like a bully and this way you give it nothing to work with. It worked very wall for me."
Can’t tell if I have actual physical symptoms of if they’re caused by anxiety / health anxiety?,"I never had health anxiety until I moved back in with my family for a year. I have just moved back out, but being around my dad who panics over the smallest of physical symptoms, has really affected me.

For example, my ankle hurts from time to time. I told my dad this and he said it sounded like a blood clot and I needed to see a GP ASAP. Of course I panicked and saw one, they said vitamin D deficiency. It keeps coming back however, and recently I was given folic acid tablets too. I don’t know the underlying cause.

Death Anxiety,"Could someone please help me cope with death anxiety attacks, and tell me why am I not going to die ","Okay. Those sound like typical anxiety physical symptoms. I was asking in case you might have some serious illness. 

So in order to get over this, you must not try to seek any kind of reassurance how you're not going to die, As the fear is from not tolerating uncertainty. By seeking reassurance, it gets even harder to tolerate uncertainty. While staying in uncertainty on purpose will make you slowly get used to it."

Health anxiety I think?,I’m constantly worried if I have something wrong with me. With my heart or my brain or something is wrong. Then I check some of these symptoms online and it fucks me over thinking I have 18 different things wrong with me. I was wondering if anyone else deals with this. Or if this is even health anxiety ,It’s definitely health anxiety. I struggle with this too. Whenever I have a symptom I always assume the worst

Please read I need help ,"Hi I’m a 22m with GAD, I’m currently on a med increase from 20-40mg of Prozac, three days ago I did coke and got drunk bc I’m a dipshit, and Ive had the absolute worst anxiety I’ve ever had today, absolutely terrified I’ll lose control and I’ll go crazy, and I’m extremely worried about serotonin syndrome or if doing coke and drinking on the med increase will make me feel this way forever now ","Hi, I don't really know what coke does together with this. The drinking shouldn't be a big deal if it was one time thing. Either way, if you didn't have any too bad of a reaction, it might be fine. Usually if anything, the reaction would start shortly afterwards. So I can't be sure, but I think you'll be fine. 

Also you can't lose control and go crazy. That sounds like you are having intrusive thoughts. People with that are often terrified of it happening, but it never actually happens."

I know I never set boundaries for myself and just being consumed by these individual and I’m doing my best to move forward instead of being stuck in my own sadness but I keep having bad anxiety at night when I’m trying to sleep and during the day. It’s usually triggered I feel when I think of them knowing my days are completely different now. The anxiety makes my heart feel super heavy and my chest starts to hurt to where I want to hold my chest and I feel shaky and like I can hardly breathe. I’m not sure what more I can do to help reduce this anxiety because it is getting physically painful and exhausting. I can try to explain more if needed

It's crucial to not engage in any anxiety related behavior. For example don't try to tell yourself how it's better this way, but also not how it's worse. The point is to not do what anxiety is trying to make you to do. But you can use acceptance. Meaning tell yourself how no matter what, you'll handle it fine. Outside of that try as if you're being a passive observer to your mind. As if your thoughts are coming from a speaker you just listen to, but not engage. This way it gets slowly better. 

Also this is always heavilly affected by lack of sleep. So if possible, try to get enough. And no caffeine."

I know I told myself I don’t want to stay on this bridge where it just rocks back and forth and I’m having a very miserable time. The feeling of sadness is such an old feeling at this point and I’m doing my best to get myself back up but I guess I haven’t fully accepted the break up.

Some days I’m ok but I guess days like today are hard. I want to be fully ok one day I guess too I fear I’ll never be ok but you’re words have helped a lot I feel it’s the words I been searching for thank you so much again

It might take some time though. But eventually with the right approach and time you will get there. 

One thing I should point out with anxiety and worrying is how the core of it is always not being comfortable with uncertainty. And the solution is to not seek certainty in your thoughts and instead embrace the fact how anything can happen, good or bad. And always leave thinking about it on that note. And that way become slowly comfortable with uncertaitny, making anxiety stop as a result."

There are so many articles by experts on it if you google it. I found even just by reading it it makes anxiety better from seeing how there is logic to all this worrying and therefore a way out of it.

Can someone talk to me or help me calm down,"Ive had anxiety forever but recently its become so unbearable. Some days I can function and act “normal” but usually I can’t get out of bed because I am too anxious to do anything. I live with my boyfriend and he is pretty much my only friend but I have been having such bad anxiety it has been causing fights because I freeze and feel like I physically cannot speak or communicate. I feel so hopeless and I have so many panic attacks. I can barely sleep and im usually up all night worrying. I really dont know what to do at this point as it feels like I have tried everything (therapy, so many different medications, breathing exercises, journaling, etc) and nothing seems to help. 
It is extremely difficult to feel this way 24/7 and I feel worthless and like I am making no progress in life.
Even just typing this out has been difficult because it is so hard to explain how Im feeling.
If anyone could help or share their experiences 
I would really appreciate it ","Hello, friend! I know what you’re dealing with. Please know you’re not alone. How is your gut health?"
Difficulty waking up?,"Almost every morning, I struggle to wake up and stay awake. I become fully aware that I’m asleep, and keep trying to get myself up, but my dream keeps “resetting” and it gets super frustrating and stressful. These “loops” feel like they last hours. 

When I do snap out of it and actually wake up, it’s disorienting and I feel exhausted. Sometimes I feel like I must still be dreaming for a while after getting up. (I struggle with derealization.)

I have an alarm on my phone, but it doesn’t help much. If it wakes me up and I turn it off, I will fall asleep again. If I hit snooze, I’ll fall asleep for the 5 minutes before the next alarm. I sometimes have to hit snooze several times before my brain actually wakes up enough to sit up. I’m pretty sure I’ve hit it in my sleep before.","Duuude that's exacly what's been happening to me a year back, and these ""snooze"" dreams are no joke. 

You should avoid snooze calls every few minutes, it's only making dreams weirder and waking up more difficult. Get a separate device that isn't your phone and place it in some difficult to reach location.  


There are alarm clock apps that force you to use a math formula or some shite like that to wake up, but they can be killed by opening up the app manager, so just skip em cuz *sleepy you* is a master of hacks lol. 

Hang the clock on the ceiling, on the curtain rod, place it on the top shelf somewhere. Do it till you start waking up naturally at set time, even on weekends, and don't try going back to sleep even if it's a bit too early."
Anxiety about bump to the head,"Hi everyone, I hope this is ok to post but just need a little bit of reassurance to help my anxiety from spiralling.

I recently moved into my own home, living alone for the first time. It’s been a month now and I feel ok but always nervous in case something happens (either an accident/illness/home emergency). I have pretty bad GAD and health anxiety which is not helpful.

I have just bumped the back/side (behind ear but on the top) of my head on an open cupboard door pretty hard. It was an hour ago and I don’t feel sick or dizzy, but my head hurts where it was bashed.

Basically I’m now terrified that I’ll have one of those cases of a TBI from just a silly bump. 

I think if I was still living with my parents I wouldn’t be as worried as I know they are there if I needed medical help. 

I know that Reddit isn’t for medical advice and we should visit the doctor if in doubt. But as this was an hour ago and I feel mostly fine, just getting anxious, does this sound just like a general bump to the head and I’m not going to die in the night 😭

Thank you for taking the time to read and hope that people don’t mind that I’m probably catastrophising here.","I get punched in the head / face every week due to my kickboxing training  , if your able to type these well put together paragraphs you’re fine, you’d be vomiting , not able to walk, pupils all messed up, not know your own name if you were concussed to the point of being on deaths door (you’re not concussed at all ) you’re fine."

Anxiety about a potential surgery,"Probably pretty stupid but anxiety is eating at me so here goes. I have slight tmj (only when opening my mouth far)an overbite and recessed chin. My dentist mentioned braces once when i was maybe 13, never again and always says my teeth have been fine since then. I have no complications sleeping chewing etc but i stumbled across jaw surgery for the 'issues' i do have and since then my anxiety has just kinda peaked because im absolutely TERRIFIED of mouth/jaw/throat procedures (i've never had any medical procedure done) would it be likely for me to need a procedure done despite having 0 complications as of now? Im seeing someone for my tmj soon and i'll ask them about it, just wondering if something so big would be needed/cause further complications if i dont have any issues right now and if anyone who had the surgery thinks it was worth it. Im just insanely scared and could use some reassurance",I've talked to someone who had that surgery and they said it was horrible. But they needed it because of severe symptoms. Even my doctor says that's a procedure you don't want unless you absolutely have to have it. So if you're not having serious complications they'll probably deny doing it anyway.

I get anxious or scared of half the stuff i see on the phone when im like this. Everything is so negative. 

Someone please talk to me? Am I losing my mind getting some sort of psychosis? I feel like I am. Maybe im disassociation or something I don’t know what that exactly feels like but I feel bad. I’m so sensitive to anyone being mean to me now too that’s what set me off today but it’s been worse all week. I feel like no one in my house will help me they want more more more of me I’m trying so hard. ",Thanks so much for this reply. The only medicine I take it Ativan everyday but it’s low dose so it’s not helping much. I feel so sensitive to stress and there’s a lot to be stressed about right now I guess.
I think I’m losing my mind help ,"I have surgery in like a week on my brain. I just moved my whole room a week ago downstairs into this little room cuz I can’t even walk up my stairs. I have a problem with tachycardia constantly and a lot of it is made worse by stress. My mom and my bf were getting onto me being mean to me today and I feel like I’m losing my mind.

Ugh i hope this is just anxiety,"So about every few months or so, usually when I have a small break or gap between classes (like days), I start feeling like absolute garbage…? Like I get shaky, anxious, my blood pressure is low and my heart rate is high, I feel like I can’t breathe, and I can’t sleep well…? I’m hoping that maybe it’s either just my anxiety or POSSIBLY my Trintellix…? anyone else have this issue?",Anxiety!!! It happens during downtime... which is just great as it robs you of relaxation!

pretty sure my tonsils have to be removed (health anxiety),"i am suffering from tonsillitis rn, but the thing is i was JUST sick from my throat a few days ago. and here i am again. 

i heard that doctors will usually recommend a tonsillectomy for reoccurring tonsillitis. i dont think it’d be recommended to me yet tho since this is only the second time i’ve had it. 

the hypochondriac in me is trembling.","Had mine removed when I was around 10. Peice of cake. Throat was sore for a few days afterward, but a week later, it was like nothing was done... except no more tonsillitis."

They honestly likely won’t especially since you’ve only had two illnesses. You’d need like 12 in a year. Also sometimes infections “spread” which seems more likely since it was three days apart. You just haven’t gotten rid of it completely. Go back to a dr and get some medicine.

Bad anxiety,"Hi, I have been have terrible anxiety with no cause for the past 3-4 days. I took cbd to help mellow me out and it just stopped the bad anxiety, there was still the stomach anxiety. Last night I had an attack that lasted an hour, I had to take my gfs mom's old panic attack medicine. Idk what to do. these three days have been awful. Should I got to the doctor? It's taking over my life. I haven't eaten much, I threw up weird white substance(which could've been whipped cream but it happened twice so idk), and I've been so scared of everything. My dissociating has been at an all time high. Should I go to the doctor? ","I'll never talk anyone out of going to the doctor when they are struggling. What i can say is that if you ate whipped cream and then your vomit was white, it was definitely the whipped cream! Anxiety can make you puke, but it can't give you specific vomit colors! 

Im feeling the same way as you, man, for the last month. I keep telling myself terrible things are going to happen. I'm like guaranteeing myself of it. I'm very slowly getting out of the fog, though. Small steps at a time. Just a week ago, I was completely feeling like I was falling apart, almost called a hotline and everything. Just be kind to yourself and try to keep logical thinking at the forefront. Time will pass, and you will be okay. I absolutely feel for you and am RIGHT where you are. ❤️"
I’m tired of being anxious,I’m tired. I’m anxious all the time. I can’t make connections with people. My own family even. I can’t function at work. I have to be a completely different person and everyone knows it’s fake. I’m so tired of fighting this. It’s been almost a decade of constant fighting. I’m tired. I don’t want to do this anymore. I don’t want to die but I’m so frustrated and over living my life like I’m being hunted for sport. My face is always showing stress. I never look happy. I never glow with happiness. I look like I’m dead already. ,"Me im the oppisite . When im anxious i talk
My head off and i just make instant connections i find it helps my anxiety and i feel safe 😭😭🩵"

Wanted to make a post about my recent experiences.,"I always believed that anxiety was solely that feeling you get in your gut, when you're nervous in front of your crush or before you were going to do a presentation or public speak. I had never realized how bad it can actually get. I was actually one of the people that said, oh, it's just anxiety. It's just in your head until I started having panic attacks myself very recently.

Dear God, it is one of the most horrifying things I have went through in my entire life. From the feeling like you're dying to overthinking every last thing, even something as small as a small pain in your foot that came from you slightly bumping it as you stumble around in an anxious stupor, dizzy, can't eat, new pains popping up from anxiety ALONE making it 10x worse (I didn't even know I could just hurt in that spot...?)

The brain fog and mental horribleness/complete change in mentality that just *exists* while you are in a rut of anxiety and stress is just the cherry on top as well. I've seen so many people just like me that have went to the ER for symptoms, being told that they are perfectly fine and healthy and just have to deal with the demon that has sprouted inside of their own minds. 

Everyone here is so strong. Those that suffer are so strong and brave, and I didn't realize it before it happened to me. I just learned that my mom was diagnosed with a panic disorder at age 27, and it seems like I might be developing that as well at 24. 

I will never, ever talk down with ""it's just anxiety"" ever again.","I relate to exactly this. When I first started experiencing anxiety I made a post “Oh THIS is anxiety?” to a very similar tune to your post. 

I’ve recently been learning from my therapist about the difference between state and trait anxiety. Basically it’s like triggers vs baseline anxiety. State anxiety is what we feel when a specific triggering thing comes along - a flight, an appointment, a presentation. Trait anxiety is the baseline levels of anxiety we feel at any given moment. And we all have some level of trait anxiety I think. It’s healthy to have a part of our brain that helps us plan ahead, account for potential challenges, avoid problems. I call that part of myself the the navigator. He likes to plan adventures and avoid dangers. But it’s like for some of us, an event will come along where it’s like that Navigator gets gamma radiation, and goes into hulk mode. Now instead of just helping us avoid real dangers on the map, it’s perceiving everything as a potential danger. “What if there’s rocks in the ocean that aren’t on the map?? What if there’s a kraken??”. It gets supercharged with strength, running around and pinning down all the other crew members. Actually Inside Out 2 does an amazing job of portraying this IMO.

But at a practical, real level, I get exactly what you mean. It’s like your brain just completely changes. All the lightness and hope in your heart feels gone. The pep is gone from your step. The hulk-mode navigator is gripping into your stomach and heart. You feel nauseated and like your heart is racing. Your brain is constantly drawn to worst case instead of best case scenarios. You have intrusive thoughts. It could be the best, chillest, most enjoyable day on paper and instead of just being happy about it, your brain has like a gravitational pull toward ‘but what if… [insert horrible thing]”. Like why?? The normal brain — my brain just a few months ago!! - wouldn’t do that. It wouldn’t dwell on all the scary potentials and what ifs. It would simply enjoy the pleasant reality. I wouldn’t have to spend so much of my mental energy reminding my anxious part “that fear isn’t current or present, so we don’t need to worry about it.”

Basically, it’s like some event happens, and our baseline of anxiety gets turned up to 11, so then when any normal trigger comes along it feels that much more extreme.

I feel like people who have never experienced this heightened anxiety have a hard time understanding. It’s hard to understand how consuming it is. How physical it is. How hard it makes it to be present. How much mental work it takes every day just to try and keep that baseline of anxiety at what feels like a manageable level. 

I will say a few things I’ve learned just in these four months I’ve been dealing with it — 

1) I spent the first few months trying really hard to manage the anxiety. I spent most of every day focused on it, trying to fix it. Understandable - it’s so intense. But the moments/days when I’ve felt like my trait anxiety was the lowest were when I just moved past it. I woke up and took a more proactive approach to the day. I got busy with work, spending time with friends, playing a game, doing a hobby. By not letting the anxiety dominate the conversation, and adopting more of a ‘bring it on’ mindset, the trait anxiety felt much less extreme.

2) It does seem to be getting better. My limited understanding is that the trait anxiety feels more intense because something (a traumatic experience, a panic attack, bad experience with alcohol or drugs, whatever it may be) disregulated your nervous system. HPA axis is out of balance, cortisol levels out of wack, cortisol receptors hyper sensitized. It’s like breaking a bone - it breaks in a moment, but can take months of care to heal correctly. For me, now four months into this journey, it’s still a journey. Some days are still pretty bad, some not as bad. Most days anxiety is still a constant presence in my mind. But some days I started noticing some hours that felt almost normal again. Then more hours of more days. A few weeks ago I had a few days where I hardly noticed any anxiety and I almost felt like my old self. Then it came back a bit. It’s non-linear, but with continued care and intentionality I can see how week over week, month over month, it seems like that trait anxiety is slowly returning back to more normal levels. 

In the meantime, on one hand I’m daily reminded that I’m stronger than I think. What feels like it will overwhelm or consume me, actually doesn’t. I endure. And I still find moments of laughter and joy that make it all worth it. But one the other hand - God I hope to start feeling better soon. It’s exhausting. I’m so tired of waking up every day, and the first question in my mind being an assessment of how intense the anxiety feels. I’m tired of spending my whole day trying to decide what will best help calm my anxiety in this moment - should I watch a show? Visit with friends? Drink some tea? I’m tired of every day trying to decide whether I should tell my spouse how my anxiety feels that day and just venting, or is she tired of hearing about it and I should just keep it to myself? Will talking about it just make me focus on it more - making it worse, or will talking about it help me process the anxious thoughts in a healthy way? Is writing this comment helping or hurting? I’m just tired of all of it. I want to feel normal again. I have hope that I will with time. But like… God please let that be sooner than later."
I feel like giving up,"I feel like I'm dying. This cant just be anxiety. I feel annoying going to the hospital and bothering Drs every week but it just gets worse. Worse than it's ever been. My heart can't take this. It beats out of my chest everyday. Multiple times a day. I can't breathe and I feel week. I'm sick after just being sick so I'm sure it makes it worse but I feel weak. All I think about is blood clots, cardiac arrest and stopping breathing. I never used to wake up from this but a few months ago I started waking up with panic attacks. At first it was feeling like I couldn't breathe. Now I wake up shaking, feeling like I'm actually dying, heart pounding and I can't breathe. It's just getting worse and I'm scared I'm dying soon or like the cardiologist missed something. I read that panic attacks can cause cardiac arrest and heart issues. I've had them everyday for 2 years. It got better for a few months but now I'm at an all time low. Idk if it's the seasons or my life. It has been stressful and I'm pregnant and terrified of birth. I can't do this I feel like I'm going to drop dead soon. I'm so dizzy. My chest hurts. I can't do this much longer",You arent bothering doctors . i know some of them can be dicks and be like “ were tired of this patient” but good doctors will do a full work up on you and tell you if something is really wrong . i have a chronic illness - im always in hospital getting treatments or prescriptions for it . Some people with my condition are more urgent than me but that doesnt make me crying wolf or anything - it just makes me less severe at the time and YES NOT DYING LOL . I had one episode where i could have died . Since then i always feel i need to be in hospital cause i dont trust my damn body

If your ancestors didn’t feel like they were going to die, they would have died. Anxiety is just a part of your threat detection system and each symptom can be linked to an evolutionary benefit, even down to anxiety-induced yawning which provides your brain with more oxygen. Of course the threat *identification* system in anxious people is out of whack - your amygdala is a like a lookout but it has shit eyesight. It sends low-resolution first impressions to the brain and can jump to conclusions so to speak. Better safe than sorry when in nature. But of course nowadays we don’t have many ways to calibrate that threat detection system since everything is much more accommodating."

Why does anxiety make you feel and think that you’re dying?,"It’s never, oh yeah it hurts or yeah I’m feeling weird! It’s always death! Lol.","Your brain's amygdala has a hyper-reactive response to stimuli that aren't life-threatening but are perceived to be. The fight or flight response is an evolved reaction from survival threats when humans were primitive. Your heart rate increases, your breathing is faster, your body sweats, digestion slows and tunnel vision occurs to focus on the threat. This makes sense if you were an early human chased by a saber-toothed tiger. Overreacting to a rustling branch was how humans survived. Our ancient biology is out of sync with modern times. This response is deeply ingrained in our sympathetic nervous system. Your brain can't distinguish between physical threats and the stresses of modern life. It looks at it all the same.

For me, understanding the why has helped me navigate debilitating panic attacks. There is no saber tooth tiger. It's all in my head. This to shall pass."

Why does anxiety make you feel and think that you’re dying?,"It’s never, oh yeah it hurts or yeah I’m feeling weird! It’s always death! Lol.","I haven’t figured out how to cope with this yet. My anxiety came when my health started taking a turn for the worse. I had to get a tumor removed out of my neck, my lipid panel is concerning, it all hit me hard and fast. I didn’t have kids until my late 30s, I’m 42 and have two kids who depend on me. I also became very aware of my own mortality when my father passed.

My anxiety causes severe insomnia. I barely sleep anymore unless I’m medicated but before I finally found a doctor that would listen to me I went 6 years on sleeping 5 hours or less every 24 hours. I swear it has chemically changed how my brain functions. I get panic attacks where I think I’m having a heart attack sometimes and it almost knocks the wind out of me. I always feel so terrified when it happens. I don’t want to die and leave my kids without their mother. That scares me more than anything in this world.

I have completely changed as a person since I saw my father’s body after he passed. It messed with me so bad mentally, I don’t think I’ll ever be able to go back to who I was. A person who was “normal”. I regret seeing him everyday as horrible as that sounds. It took off the blindfold, I guess is the best way I could think of it. I never thought about death like I do now, I knew we all die but it didn’t become real until I saw a dead body.

I miss my dad of course but I miss who I was before, too. I can’t sleep, the thought of death consumes me and has ruined my life."

Lol.","All I know is that the body’s survival switch turns on, fight or flight, the brain sending you all kinds of bodily signals to get the hell away from this thing, whatever it is…

Basically if you don’t run or act now you’ll die probably, which if you think about it is a great ability to have in a real dangerous situation where death is likely to happen like getting attacked by an animal, a person trying to kill you etc, 

It’s just how our brains have kept us alive for centuries even though it constantly confuses real danger from non danger in modern times. The brain only receives a threat message from the sensory system of the brain as in sight, smell, sounds, touch and even memories. 

whatever delusional fear we might experience or worry about in the moment, the brain collects data from the sensory being triggered, and put together the pieces to what is going on based on whatever past trauma or scary events we’ve experienced. Like our own personal computer system. 

-and then it goes on its clever little mission to prepare your body to fight or run away from this thing so you don’t end up dying, which is the feeling of dying/dread/impending doom we experience from anxiety. 

Like oh my god the brain is so good at convincing me that I am indeed going to die anytime soon, like no logical reasoning can convince me otherwise."

Why does anxiety make you feel and think that you’re dying?,"It’s never, oh yeah it hurts or yeah I’m feeling weird! It’s always death! Lol.","TW: Panic attacks.
I guess for me it's being unable to lower my bpm. Also being unable to breathe. And I can't swallow. Also i feel extreme temperatures--hot, cold, always sweating. I dissocciate and feel like I'm upside down. I feel like I'm floating above the ground, outside of my body. I feel that i'm already dead and didn't realize it. My skin gets cold. Sometimes hot. I lose feeling in my limbs. I gasp for breath and text goodbyes to family. Then it gets much worse. But that's just me. Everyone's different."

When we feel anxiety of a certain magnitude, it can only feel reasonably justified by the assumption that we are dying. That’s my best guess anyway."
Why does anxiety make you feel and think that you’re dying?,"It’s never, oh yeah it hurts or yeah I’m feeling weird! It’s always death! Lol.","Makes me feel like I’m having a heart attack. I went and got tests done. EKG, echocardiogram etc. All came back normal. My heart palpitations are from the anxiety. I’ve sorta just got to the point anymore I’m like “fuck it” and it hasn’t been bothering me as much. Xanax helps me tremendously"

Why does anxiety make you feel and think that you’re dying?,"It’s never, oh yeah it hurts or yeah I’m feeling weird! It’s always death! Lol.","A thought on what to do from someone who solved his anxiety attacks (and it’ll make you screen symptoms better) 

I got an Apple Watch with the ekg function. Learned the basics on how to read them and everytime I had an anxiety attack I’d pull an ekg. You’ll quickly see that your heart is fine and now you can rationally tell yourself nothing is wrong. You may need to ride the wave of an attack a couple of times (I recommend a physiological suppressor like hydroxyzine) but over time you’ll learn to read the precursor symptoms of your anxiety, you’ll learn to trust your physical body and you’ll be able to calm yourself before it ever starts. 

The worst thing about curing or recovering from severe anxiety is you will suffer through attacks on the way out but you need to learn your triggers and learn to see the attack before you are in the middle of it"

Does anyone else always feel guilty even when it's not your fault?,"I don't know if it's because of anxiety as I'm not diagnosed but just to name a few, I feel guilty for homeless people, litter on the floor and the cooked turkey on the table during thanksgiving. It's like Im not able to do anything, I'm helpless. I should've saved this turkey, I should buy food for this homeless person or I should recycle more.

I remember my mother bought me something and said she got tricked (the blanket was smaller than expected) and I felt so heartbroken for her. Every time my mom has gotten scammed out of something, I feel like it's my fault. I obviously don't express this but I hate this unnecessary guilt that I get. Just seeing someone fall, a blind person just walking, someone in a wheelchair or a janitor doing their job. I feel grateful and guilty at the same time but the guilt overweighs the gratefulness.",All the time

I think quitting porn made my anxiety go through the roof,"I only recently connected these two dots together.

I was on about a 40 days abstention when I started to have a gradually growing hunger for air. It's like no matter how much I take in, sometimes it's just not enough, and I feel like I need to take deep breaths every few seconds.

Didn't do a whole suite of tests, but my lungs and oxygen levels (98) are fine, and I'm able to do aerobic exercise without really feeling deprived of oxygen.

It's only when I'm busy with something outside of myself that I notice I didn't have any need to gasp for air.  It's been like this for about a month now and a couple of times I actually ended up losing a full night of sleep over it.

Trying to do some meditation like I used to but that constant hunger for air is making it near impossible, I'm feeling reluctant to even try anymore if I'm being honest.

I used to take SSRI's but they stopped working, so I tapered off comepletly around 2 years ago.

Guys is anyone else here struggling with something similar? How did you manage it, if at all?

Either way, have a great week everyone.","Congrats on quitting porn, it’s a tough journey, not a comfortable convo you could have with most people irl, but I’m really proud of you.

Most people take drugs to cure their anxiety so yeah obviously you’re gonna be more anxious sober, but with time and maybe better alternative methods such as walking or meditating, it’ll get better"

How Can I Tell If It’s Anxiety or Medical?,"I drove back home for Thanksgiving this weekend which was something I’ve been pretty anxious to do for several weeks, my longest solo drive of 4.5 hours, however, it went amazing and I was surprisingly really comfortable during the whole trip! I was also excited to do it because I knew once I was done with this drive, I’d be able to enjoy this week back home with family, but for some reason, I’ve felt sick all week. Incredibly fatigued, somewhat nauseous, body aches, THICK headache for the last few days, however I bought a thermometer and it’s reading normal, and I don’t have any congestion / cough. So is this just anxiety? I have a theory that my symptoms are staying around because I don’t want to do a drive back to Chicago with an illness like the flu, or Covid, so I’m waiting for these symptoms to go away, hyper observing them, and therefore keeping them around. Any experience/advice for me here? ","Congrats on your long solo drive. What an achievement. I’m not a doctor, so I can’t give any medical advice, but it does sound like anxiety. I experienced this the other day when I didn’t want to do something and my body reacted to it because I was working myself up. I ended up doing what I didn’t want to do and the day after I suffered even more anxiety I think because I was so stressed. Soo frustrating what anxiety can do"

Stuck in flight or fight response after traumatic event ,"Something traumatic happened to me on Thursday, and I’ve been stuck in a fight or flight response. I didn’t realize until today that I’m exhausted, can’t sleep, I’m so angry and my mind is running rampant with these scenarios playing 24/7. My body is aching, and I’m so cold. My hands and feet are so cold it’s nauseating, and the back of my neck aches. I was going to the hospital when I accidentally read about the symptoms of something I was experiencing, but I think it’s just anxiety. Any tips? ","Take some magnesium/calcium/vitamin d with chamomile tea at night then turn off all electronics before bed including blue light stuff. Do not drink any caffeine or sugar or carbs before bed. Some high fat items like cottage cheese, sour cream ect can be helpful as high calcium foods help slow down the sympathetic nervous system which is the fight or flight system.

Stuck in flight or fight response after traumatic event ,"Something traumatic happened to me on Thursday, and I’ve been stuck in a fight or flight response. I didn’t realize until today that I’m exhausted, can’t sleep, I’m so angry and my mind is running rampant with these scenarios playing 24/7. My body is aching, and I’m so cold. My hands and feet are so cold it’s nauseating, and the back of my neck aches. I was going to the hospital when I accidentally read about the symptoms of something I was experiencing, but I think it’s just anxiety. Any tips? ","Hey , you’ll be okay. I know I don’t know what you’ve been through but I hope you’ll find peace and eventually start to feel better . The stars only come out when the sun goes down , never forget that. The darkness in the sky allow us to see the beautiful bright stars more clearly . Good luck 🙂"

Anyone on Beta Blockers?,"I was prescribed 10mg Propranolol to use as needed for my anxiety, on top of the Trintellix I am also taking.

Started medication for Anxiety,"I have been put on 10 mg Propanolol and 25 mg Setraline and i feel my mind is empty, not happy just empty. I do not feel the ohysical effects of anxiety so that is good, but still I dont feel like doing anything and it is quite scary.

Any tips?","I'd say what you're experiencing is normal! Of course you're sad, you've had a falling out! You're sad... but you're not anxious. Why? Because having a falling out with people in your life is normal. If you weren't on medication, you'd be in a total spiral right now! Normal people don't spiral over stuff so easily. Your medication is allowing you to feel sad (normal human response to your situation) but not go into a shame anxiety spiral. It sounds like the meds are doing their thing!

I can’t handle silence ,"Around 6 months ago, I had my first real death in the family. My grandfather who I was VERY close to. After that my parents divorced and i’ve fallen into a drug addiction. However my biggest concern is, I can’t handle silence and my own thoughts. 

i’ve always had anxiety, i’ve been diagnosed for years however I honestly forgot about it, it was under control thanks to my medication but however recently i’ve noticed i get very very anxious and afraid, almost a sense of dread when i’m not listening, watching, or actively doing something. It’s gotten so bad I can’t shower without music, a podcast, can’t sleep without falling asleep to a video or some sounds. I can’t even go outside on a walk cause i get so scared of my own thoughts, i’ve never been like this. I’ve always loved silence gave me time to think, but i’m so scared of facing my own reality. I know i cannot live like this forever, so what do i do? I’m slowly starting to try and ween off my phone. I started taking showers without any background noise or watching a video, it’s scary but it’s possible. I get extremly anxiety though and it’s debilitating, what do i do?","Meditation, start low.

Got my first tattoo yesterday,"Tattoo went fine, easy peasy.

I can't do my school work without drinking whiskey and punching myself in the head.,"EDIT: I don't drink. Normally alcohol either goes bad in my house or loses all potency because I will open a bottle and not come back to it until 8+ months later.  If I buy a 6-pack of anything, I will forget about it, it will get pushed to the back of the fridge, and just be a nice surprise god knows how long later. For some reason, drinking and pain is the only thing that seems to help me do my homework. 



I flunked out of my master program a year ago because I couldn't bring myself to log into my classes, and I just started again, straight into a 625 level class. 

I don't know if it's the depression, adhd, anxiety, ideation, or what; but I can't do my papers without drinking an unhealthy amount of whisky and punching myself in the head hard enough to really hurt. 

I don't know what I hope to accomplish posting here, but I have to do something. 

I'm also over 50, negotiating a divorce, saving my job, trying to figure out what to do with my dogs because when we sell the house I can't keep them and my wife can't either. which sucks because they are litterally the only reason I'm not dead already. 

Did I forget the suicidal ideation is getting more and more tempting every day? 

Fuck the dogs, fuck my parents, thank god I never had kids, I just want to go some days. 

The thing that really fucking sucks is I work in behavioral health, and I genuinely help people. People open up to me and I truly care. The therapists I work with asked me to dial it back because the patients were bonding with me so hard they were having trouble connecting. I was just being my fucking self.

Thank you.","I have been where you are.  Life can get to be too much and it sounds like everything has piled up in your life.  It’s not too late to start over.  Next year will be a lot different than it is now for you.  Is there an AA support group near you?  If you can cut back on the alcohol/stop drinking, that would help a lot.  Getting out of the house helped me.  I don’t know if you are religious or not?  If you are, you know that the devil is a liar who tells us our current state is forever.  If you can try to change your mindset to taking life one day at a time, it doesn’t feel as overwhelming.  Good luck and God Bless."
I can't do my school work without drinking whiskey and punching myself in the head.,"EDIT: I don't drink. Normally alcohol either goes bad in my house or loses all potency because I will open a bottle and not come back to it until 8+ months later.  If I buy a 6-pack of anything, I will forget about it, it will get pushed to the back of the fridge, and just be a nice surprise god knows how long later. For some reason, drinking and pain is the only thing that seems to help me do my homework. 



I flunked out of my master program a year ago because I couldn't bring myself to log into my classes, and I just started again, straight into a 625 level class. 

I don't know if it's the depression, adhd, anxiety, ideation, or what; but I can't do my papers without drinking an unhealthy amount of whisky and punching myself in the head hard enough to really hurt. 

I don't know what I hope to accomplish posting here, but I have to do something. 

I'm also over 50, negotiating a divorce, saving my job, trying to figure out what to do with my dogs because when we sell the house I can't keep them and my wife can't either. which sucks because they are litterally the only reason I'm not dead already. 

Did I forget the suicidal ideation is getting more and more tempting every day? 

Fuck the dogs, fuck my parents, thank god I never had kids, I just want to go some days. 

The thing that really fucking sucks is I work in behavioral health, and I genuinely help people. People open up to me and I truly care. The therapists I work with asked me to dial it back because the patients were bonding with me so hard they were having trouble connecting. I was just being my fucking self.

Thank you.","For me it was alcoholism and untreated anxiety. But mostly alcoholism because the withdrawals made my anxiety 10x worse. Also, I was incredibly sleep deprived because of my alcoholism which made my anxiety 10x worse and disrupted my mental processing.

Absent of any other intervention, try breaking things down into smaller chunks. Like they taught us in elementary school, start with a brain storm, then an outline, then the first draft, then final draft. This has helped me a lot with everything from paying bills to finding a new place to live to literal schoolwork."

Thank you.","Maybe you should consider taking a semester off until you’re settled with the divorce and selling the house. Moving sucks and it’s so stressful. 
Have you considered medication for anxiety? 
Or supplements? 
You don’t gotta hit yourself in the head, that’s not a good way to cope. Ashwaganda is a life saver to help my mood stabilize. After exercising, life is somehow just easier to manage."

Thank you.","I know you don’t drink, but this is how I started. 
In fact, I never liked alcohol. I heard so many bad things about it I didn’t truly try drinking until my early 20s, and due to peer pressure. But that was also when I developed a panic disorder, GAD, and I started drinking to self medicate. 

Today I’m an alcoholic and I’m in recovery and my God, I wish I could go back and change this. 

Do you see a therapist yourself? Have you considered maybe switching to a role that is less taxing on you?"

I'd definitely find a mental health professional and 99% sure that meds could literally be a lifesaver for you. You're so overwhelmed. What you've got going on would stress a ""normal"" person."

Arm feels fake,"I have been dealing with anxiety for about a year now, a lot of different physical symptoms: (globus sensation, heart palpitations, light headed, etc).

The past 2-3 days my left arm feels like it’s fake at times. I’ll be relaxing then I use my left arm to grab something or keep it one place, then once I move it, it feels like it’s not my arm if that makes sense. Kind of tingly or just feels like it’s fake. 

I automatically get worried, that it’s come to the point where even if I don’t think about it in my head when I’m doing those actions, I still get a scared feeling in my chest. I’m 21M, and this is getting too much at times. I just want to move on from this feeling and be happy again

Has anyone gone through this feeling as well?",I also have globus sensation. Hope you feel well again.
Masturbated to coworker to get rid of work crush while in a relationship; guilt is eating me alive ,"
All there is to it is this:

Developed a work crush, didn’t like the butterfly feelings I (m26) got from it (felt weird while being with my partner (f25). Found her socials, did the deed, crush was gone. 

I felt extremely gross after however. Later down the line my partner argued with me that when people do exactly what I did, but even to celebrities (as I also did, I figured everyone did this tbh), as she believes it is invasive and overly sexualizing someone. I disagreed, she said her view of me has changed and she “didn’t think I was that type of guy” but 2 years later we’re fine and dandy

Now, 2 years later in our 6 year relationship, seasonal depression is kicking in and I’m ruminating on my mistakes, my coworker situation being one of them. I haven’t done it since then since it felt so wrong and like I crossed a line, but I feel like I massively betrayed my partner and can only imagine how she’d feel if she found out. I feel like I’m being a master manipulator and that it’s awful to keep this a secret. 

Mind you I’d never tell her this to spare her feelings, me being guilt free isn’t worth the insecurity it could spark in her. But I still feel so dirty and guilt and like I’m actively lying to her. Idk how to get rid of this guilt with the seasonal depression. Logically I know it’s not too awful, but imagining her reaction if she ever found out is what’s driving me down the “what if” rabbit hole. Any advice is appreciated, thank you",Ugh. 😑

Any advice is appreciated, thank you","You're allowed to make mistakes in life.  And you're allowed to give yourself permission to say that's what it was and move on.

You probably need to talk to someone you can trust (thinking of a counselor) to help get this out of your head.  The power is in the thought and holding it in.  Once you can let it out to someone who can tell you ""yep, you're not the first, you're not the last, you didn't otherwise act on it, you can continue on with life,"" then you'll be able to let it go.  But thoughts are incredibly powerful and usually keep their power so long as they're stuck in our heads.

If you had a friend tell you they did this, what would you do?  Tell them it's okay, that it was a mistake?  You be understanding and compassionate.  Can you do the same for yourself?"

I don't need to know and worry about these nothings. Giving your partner harmful information just so you can ease your mind is actually a selfish thing to do.

Mind you I’d never tell her this to spare her feelings, me being guilt free isn’t worth the insecurity it could spark in her. But I still feel so dirty and guilt and like I’m actively lying to her. Idk how to get rid of this guilt with the seasonal depression. Logically I know it’s not too awful, but imagining her reaction if she ever found out is what’s driving me down the “what if” rabbit hole. Any advice is appreciated, thank you",Exactly and that’s how I know my anxiety is spiraling out of control this holiday season because my logical side is being overpowered by my worries and what-if’s
Hypochondria about new penicillin ,"I recently have had a bad case of tonsillitis and was given Amoxicillin the first time around. the second time I went to the clinic, they gave me Penicillin.

Physical Pain helps,"Does someone feel like physical pain is comforting when you are having anxiety attacks?

  
I've been having a lot lately  cause i quit weed and nicotine recently after smoking everyday for 2 years.

  
So i started training bjj and exercising a lot more to get my mind out of everything.

  
Whenever im having an anxiety attack, any physical pain makes me get my mind out of the anxiety, and i stop feeling like throwing up/butterfly stomach

  
 ","I think in this case pain can ""feel good"", because it reminds you that you did something for yourself, or something productive. As long as you're giving yourself time to rest it's fine."

You need to see a therapist to work through this. You'll never be happy until you change. The good news is that it's in YOUR control. Good luck friend. 🙂"
Has anyone else have no capability to say no or defend yourself?,"Maybe an odd question, but for years I've had no way to stand up for myself. In any situation, be it school, work, friends, family, relationships I just can't be assertive in any shape or form

Long story short I'm unhappy in my relationship and I want out. I can't get the words out and I can't tell her I don't love her anymore. She argued with me the other days bringing up some bad things I did in the past but the list of wicked stuff she's done is miles long and I can't even point out one of them","Thank you for the kind words, I'll go back to therapy"
Worsening pressure around eye ,"Back in July of this year I started seeing a floater in my right eye and experiencing sharp pains right above both eyes, but more often above the right eye. Immediately I saw my optometrist and my exam came back normal with no detachment or anything of concern. I did learn that while my astigmatism appeared to be better, she said my far sightedness has gotten worse and wrote me a new prescription for glasses (which I don’t wear because I feel like I can’t see with them).

Still had the pains & the floater then started having lots of headaches with pressure and burning sensations. Very sensitive to light (fluorescents & being outside on a sunny day without shades). Saw my ENT & she ruled out sinus issues via sinus CT which was normal. 

The past 3-4 days I’ve had a significant increase in the discomfort around my
Right eye. It feels like something is pushing on my eye socket and my Right eyebrow and temple area feel like they are in a constant state of throbbing. I’ve been trying tylenol and it doesn’t help. The only relief I have is when I’m sleeping or the first hour after I’m awake I don’t feel it then as the day begins it starts. Not sure if this is just another anxiety manifestation or something actually wrong. ","I can't be sure if it's from anxiety, bit from my experience anxiety can cause symptoms like that. I used to have that."
"i lost my cat today, this has really set my anxiety back into full speed. ","i had to put my beautiful baby girl down today at 17 years old. she was so healthy up into the days she passed and i don’t understand what happened. she was fine last week. this monday she was having a hard time eating but was still showing interest, wanting pets and cuddles, was going outside, didn’t seem unhealthy but still booked a vet appointment to be safe. the closest appointment was this friday. 

by today this morning she had been hiding in a new spot since the night before, wasn’t eating at all, wouldn’t purr if you pet her, looked extremely tired and could barely keep herself standing. she ended up peeing in the spot she was sleeping in. my other cat just passed 3 months ago, and she had the same symptoms but it was her thyroid so it was treatable, we just didn’t catch it in time as she was born with a thyroid disease that went undetected. we thought that was the problem, but it wasn’t. my mom brought her to the vet with me expecting she would get meds and be okay. she came back an hour later and said she was in kidney failure and had to be put down 💔. there was nothing we could do and no amount of money would fix her..

i went up to the vet to say goodbye to her and the rest of the day had just been a blur. i’ve been having panic attacks none stop and i just miss her so much. i can’t control my crying, everything reminds me of her. she loved to find new spots to sleep in, if a new blanket was on the floor she would sleep there for days until she found a new spot. she’ll never find a new spot again, she’ll never come running when i shake the treats again, she will never come outside with me in the backyard and play again, i’ll never be able to give her cuddles and kisses and chin scratches again. i won’t be able to hold her again, i’ll never feel her head butt my legs as i’m walking by, i’ll never see her again :( i just wanna curl up in a ball and die. i miss her so much. i’ve had her since i was 2 and now im 19. 

i don’t know how im going to get through this, i think of her and i immediately start bawling my eyes out. she was such a lovely, sweet girl. i’m gonna miss her so unbelievably much. i love you setty. i’ll see you up there one day 💔","I'm so sorry. It sounds like you gave her a good life. It's not your fault. 17 years is a good long life for a cat, and she's always going to be with you in spirit."

A few weeks ago I had to say goodbye to my dog of almost 19 years. Same sort of thing happened with her that happened with your cat, it all went bad so fast. One day we were treating what the vet thought was very mild pancreatitis, a few days later she was gone. In the days between we spent close to five figures exhausting every option on earth, but we learned that cancer doesn’t care how much money you have. My girl had a very rare (oncologist said 7 in 1 million occurrence) super aggressive tumor on one of her kidneys. The vet treating her said she’d never seen a dog live more than two weeks after diagnosis, and almost all of those cases had zero symptoms until the very end. 

It’s hard because she was full throttle just days before, even at 18 she never slowed down a bit, I thought that dog was going to outlive me. I sit here now and I just miss her. I see her everywhere in the house, I hear her running like a horse (even though she was only 10lbs) down the hallway to my office to see what I was doing. I feel her chasing me down the stairs in the morning, I still reach over to the spot she laid to scratch her head. 

We get them knowing that one day they’ll break our hearts, we know how it ends, but they give us so much while they’re here. We often form bonds with our pets that are stronger than those we have with most people. It’s not weird, it’s the result of having something by your side that’s offered you unconditional love regardless of the situation. My dog was with me through different jobs, states, and homes. She was with me when I had nothing and was right by my side through some of the worst times of my life. Whether I was struggling or flying, happy or sad, wealthy or poor, it didn’t matter. I could be having the worst day and here she’d come with that toy snake, “come on dickhead, quit being sad and throw the snake” is the look she’d give me and it was always hilarious. 

I knew she loved me, and she knew I loved her. It’s the worst pain I’ve ever felt and I’d do it again in a heartbeat. Your cat was loved, and she loved you just the same. I don’t have any magic formula for dealing with this sort of thing, I just wanted to share my story and let you know that you aren’t alone. What we feel right now is the cost of the bond we were so lucky to share, and as hard as it is, it was worth it."

I forgot that hydroxyzine has been used as an anti-anxiety drug. I take it for extreme allergies.

But don't go preaching to the world about asking for hydroxyzine. It's just not a good idea to advertise any sort of medication as if it were some miracle drug.

There are some serious side effects from hydroxyzine and several contraindications. It's important to acknowledge that some meds work for some but not for others. And we don't know what other medications other people are taking.

If you are taking hydroxyzine then you should not be taking benadryl. It can also cause cardiac issues.

You coming in here singing praises from this certain drug that worked for you can be dangerous. Some people are more careful about trying new meds and that's good. Other people, not so much. The way you posted about this medication makes me believe that you are not aware of the adverse effects of the med. Which is dangerous.

I'm glad it's helped you, but please be mindful of the fact that every medication comes with warnings and contraindications."

Psychosis or anxiety? Please help ,"
So I’ve been dealing with alot of derealisation such as my vision is only focused on one thing at a time, my head feels full and stuffy. I’m alittle confused at times but it may be anxiety. My mind is everywhere. Sometimes staring off into space for a split second or two. My mornings are really tuff until I get busy and it’s like none of that exist (I’m okay) I’m focused. I smoked for about 5 years everyday. Now I’ve been clean for about 3 months and prescribed klonopin everynight. About .125mg. If anyone has any thoughts on this. It would be great! ",I don't see a reason to think it's psychosis.

lost at 23,"I’m 23, and I’m feeling completely lost right now. I live in a country with mandatory military service, and most people here start their studies around 21 or 22. I started my degree last year at 22, but after a year, I decided to take a step back and rethink my path because I suddenly wasn’t sure about my major anymore. I started having panic attacks, and I didn’t recognize myself during that time.

I’ve always been a high-achiever, surrounded by friends, full of energy and zest for life. But in the past month, everything shifted. I felt like I couldn’t function, couldn’t stop crying. I saw a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with anxiety and mild depression, and now I’m on medication and undergoing CBT therapy.

I’m terrified of starting over at 24. Here, that’s considered “old” to begin studying again, and I still don’t know what I even want to pursue, let alone what will guarantee me a good job and future. Anxiety has completely taken over, and at the same time, I keep feeling like I’m just fooling everyone, including myself. I feel like my struggles are just a result of laziness, not real inability.

I honestly feel completely lost, and these are definitely not the life I imagined for myself at 23.

Propranolol - feels strange!,"Hey guys. So recently I've been having panic attacks and physical anxiety way more than usual because I had a panic attack out of the blue on transport a few weeks ago. Also I'd like to preface I am in therapy, and they know about this too.

I went to the doctor and was prescribed a 40mg dose of propranolol, tried it that day and felt quite calm - but I was in my safe space anyway, in my home. I tried it  again the next day and went to go take public transport to work and it felt kind of odd?

I was not doing well that morning before I took it. I woke up in a panic and sweating and heart racing, so took it and about an hour later it definitely worked. But it felt odd because I was still anxious in my head but none of the physical things happened, it felt like I had something missing? I didn't feel the rushes or heart pounding or shakiness which I think made me feel a bit weird. I have quite bad health anxiety and agoraphobia so I kept thinking ""I'm gonna be sick"" / ""I'm gonna faint"" and humiliate myself in front of everyone and not be able to get home.

Did it take you guys a bit to get used to this? I don't want the physical symptoms at all, but it was almost anxiety inducing to not have them. I came home right away and I did ""panic"" but I'm not sure if I'd call it a full blown panic attack. ",It gets rid of the physical symptoms of anxiety but not mental.

It was SO STRANGE when I had it, where I would normally feel that overwhelming rush of adrenaline throughout my body, as well as my heart racing and shaking, when I found myself in anxious situations, it just didn’t happen which ofc is what we take them for, but not feeling it after feeling it for so long was surreal. I suppose that’s what normal feels like!

I felt very ‘spacey’ when I first started them, but now I’m fine really. Like someone has mentioned, I do have very vivid and strange dreams, more so in the beginning but still now and then. Other than that, all fine tbh"

My experience was that anticipating the symptoms caused anxiety, even when those symptoms happening. But my brain eventually adapted to the new reality, and the anxiety disappeared permanently.  
    
To speed up the process, do things that used to trigger the physical symptoms as often as possible. 
   
Also - for me, it only works for 8 hours. If I forget to take it, the physical symptoms will return, but they cause only minimal anxiety now, and just remind me that I forgot my dose. 
    
Give it time, it's amazing stuff."

I went to the doctor and was prescribed a 40mg dose of propranolol, tried it that day and felt quite calm - but I was in my safe space anyway, in my home. I tried it  again the next day and went to go take public transport to work and it felt kind of odd?

I was not doing well that morning before I took it. I woke up in a panic and sweating and heart racing, so took it and about an hour later it definitely worked. But it felt odd because I was still anxious in my head but none of the physical things happened, it felt like I had something missing? I didn't feel the rushes or heart pounding or shakiness which I think made me feel a bit weird. I have quite bad health anxiety and agoraphobia so I kept thinking ""I'm gonna be sick"" / ""I'm gonna faint"" and humiliate myself in front of everyone and not be able to get home.

Did it take you guys a bit to get used to this? I don't want the physical symptoms at all, but it was almost anxiety inducing to not have them. I came home right away and I did ""panic"" but I'm not sure if I'd call it a full blown panic attack. ",It worked realy well for me but unfortunately gave me bad and vivid dreams which realy effected my sleep and therefore my anxiety

DAE struggle with terrible health anxiety to the point of panic? What is it like? How do you deal with it?,"Let me tell you about me first: 

I had an emergency health situation recently that came out of the blue and after that my health anxiety, which was high before, has gone astronomical. I've become very preoccupied with anything unusual in my body.

Like I think it's a combination of two things: I feel like I don't know my body at all. And also, I'm very aware of death coming for me eventually.

I hear about people living with painful chronic diseases and it's terrifying. Some are admitted to the hospital dozens of times a year and undergo countless terrifying procedures, whereas others die somewhere very very very slowly.

I don't want to suffer like that. I've suffered enough already in life and it's too much for one person. I don't have the guts to kill myself so it means having to live with whatever the sadistic forces of universe send for me. It's like a prison being inside a body that is slowly falling apart.

I'm so scared.

I thought maybe asking people online about their health anxiety and how they deal with it can help me.","Well, You don't deal with it easily at first. Any step that makes it even 1% easier is paid for in stress, tears, and cold sweat. I used to have panic attacks when my health anxiety would flare high enough. At the beginning, 8 years ago now, I had panic attacks a minimum of 3x daily, for almost a year. Anxiety subsided over time, and panic attacks stopped as well, because I wasn't anxious.

However, whenever anxiety would flare up again, physical symptoms would come back which would almost inevitably spiral into a panic attack. It was only recently that I became capable of feeling anxiety without freaking out into a panic attack. I would feel anxiety come as well as my symptoms, acknowledge them, let them do their thing knowing that when anxiety would subside, so would the symptoms. Because they're symptoms of anxiety, not of a health issue.

It took very hard work to ingrain into my mentality that my symptoms are anxiety symptoms, and not serious health issues. One of the grander steps was the realization that, honestly, no matter how bad they felt, they were pretty superificial and non-serious. It was my anxious state that would blow these symptoms out of proportion. All these stabbing pains, lightheadedness, sensations, whatnot, when You boil it down, it's all mostly just sensations and not actual symptoms. See, if I had thrown up instead of just being a bit dizzy, I'd have cause for concern. Had my leg gone proper numb instead of transient pins-n-needles feelings, sure, that's concerning. Pins-n-needles aren't. I have headaches because I'm under stress, not because I've brain cancer or what the fuck have you.

You have to accept uncertainty. Easy way or the hard way, but You have to. You have to forcefeed Your psyche that uncertainty is a fact of life, and so is death. People die. You too will die, so will I. Trust me, we are lucky to not be certain about our deaths, not everyone has the privilege not to know when and how they will die.

  
You also have to de-train Yourself from Googling, researching diseases and whatnot, and body-scanning. Stopping Googling and symptom checking and reassurance seeking is straightforward, but maybe not easy always. However, it IS straightforward and as long as You put in effort, You will cut out this mechanism that easily affords spirals. If You feel a symptom, feel it, move on and do not bodyscan. If You find Yourself falling into these habits, You must make a conscious effort to stop them, which will later become a semi-conscious effort, until You completely stop engaging in these behaviours."
People who overcame agoraphobia. What worked for you?,,"What worked for me was leaving the house little by little using ""safe places"". A ""safe place"" is just a place I designate in my mind that I can go to if I start feeling panic.   
  
For example, I started by making my first ""safe place"" my neighbor's house.  Then I began furthering those places. I would mark my neighbors house and then another house across the street and then a gas station at the corner and then a store a little further. Each time I was able to reach a ""safe place"" my confidence grew. Little by little, the ""safe places"" become more spaced out and further until I was able to get on the highway. On the highway, I would designate cars in proximity as ""safe places"" and also exits. Before I knew it, I was able to leave my house and go to shops, etc. 

While doing this, you have to accept the possibility of a panic attack. Do not try to control them, anticipate them or avoid them. Just set your mind to accept them and let them occur. As long as you have your ""safe space"" you can also go there and have your panic attack and then continue on. 

Also cell phones have made this easier because it is basically an electronic ""safe space"". Just designate in your mind a friend or family member that you can call, at any time. Just knowing that you can call this ""safe person"" will reduce anxiety considerably."

People who overcame agoraphobia. What worked for you?,,"The only thing that worked for me and has ever works for me is homelessness. My house was condemned, and I had no choice. I eventually wound up in crisis and that’s when I kinda was like these people are awesome.

Made a lot of friends there, I still keep in touch with most of them. I don’t know if that works for you, but sometimes you don’t have a choice. Now I’m pretty content with my life where I am."
People who overcame agoraphobia. What worked for you?,,"It’s still very much a struggle for me, but here are some things that helped me. Familiarity. I would go on walks with my friend around the neighborhood at night, we’d take the same path. Eventually I began to feel more comfortable, because nothing bad was happening so I started pushing myself to take different paths. We’d go left here when we usually went right. Things like that. We had to go at night because it was cooler and my friend didn’t like going during the day, which scared me more, but ultimately added to the experience. 
Our walks became less and less anxiety inducing. The anxiety is still there and I’m constantly watching cars or people riding bikes, whatever, but not in as much of a panic as before. 
My favorite food in the world is pho. I moved away from my favorite pho restaurant and found a new one that was just as good (if not better) close to where I had moved to. I talked my friend into going with me a lot to the point where he started to crave it just as much. It’s a small restaurant, but not hole in the wall small. I became familiar with the staff (just knowing their faces) and the environment itself. My friend got tired of it and it became harder to convince him to go with me so if I wanted pho I wouldn’t allow myself to get it because of sheer fright and for some reason I don’t like eating it at home. Because of how familiar I had gotten with the location and staff I felt a sense of ease and decided to force myself to eat there alone. I had a panic attack my first time and could barely eat my food without convincing myself I was choking or it was poisoned or someone was watching me. Of course I was okay in the end and I had to drill that I was in my head. I tried again and again and eventually I got to the point where I would go alone without any anxiety and almost preferred it as I could eat my favorite meal while watching a movie or show on my phone in a way that was preferable for me. 
Going to the same stores alone has also created that familiarity as I see the same faces each time I go which makes me feel less anxious and safe. 
Because I’m getting out so much in different ways it has helped ease my anxiety a bit when it comes to new places. 
Sorry this doesn’t exactly align with your question as it is not something I have completely overcome."
People who overcame agoraphobia. What worked for you?,,"I just push myself to get out there. I dont let the anxiety keep me sitting at home, even though it’s an everyday struggle to leave the house. I’m really proud of myself, because this summer I went to concerts, hiking, sightseeing, and a lot more. I never regret pushing myself to go out, but I always regret when I let the anxiety win and let it make me miss out on fun things I could be doing."
People who overcame agoraphobia. What worked for you?,,"I started very small. I first went for walks and slowly made the walk longer and further away. Then I would just take my car and go to the grocery store but not actually go inside but just sit in my car in the parking lot. Then when I felt ready I would go inside and buy something really cheap and just walk around a bit in the store. I did this every day till it got way easier and I didnt spend as much time in the car. Eventually I went to my local boardgame store where I would usually play boardgames. First I started with just being around people there not interacting that much, later I would have conversations with people and eventually take part in playing boardgames again. It's a gradual process and this took me a couple months to achieve. I sometimes still struggle but I try to not be too hard on myself. Every baby step is a way out of this dark place. I wish you courage to overcome this."

People who overcame agoraphobia. What worked for you?,,"I was diagnosed agoraphobic in 2007, and basically lived in a bubble from 07 until 15. I had tried a bunch of things, medicine, therapies, even self help stuff. Nothing seemed to help. 

In 15 I left work for a few months due to stress and really took time to focus on myself. During that time I got into doing mindfulness and meditation stuff, which I always dismissed as “hippie bs”. I’m talking all day every day. I went from not being able to leave the house, to freedom that I had not felt in years, within a few months. I had succeeded in turning my brain off. 

Problem is, this lifestyle isn’t practical when you have a job. I went back to work, and things slowly started to come back. However, I now had tools in my toolbox to bring myself back to a decent baseline when I needed to. I lived that way, with my bubble being bigger, until somewhere in 2023. 

In 23, stress was getting to be too much, and I started talking to doctors about medication again. My primary asked if I ever tried Buspar, which I had not, so I started using that. Weeks later, Buspar seemed to have no side effects, but also didn’t seem to make me feel much different. This is where it’s a bit odd. I found that doing things that normally I would need to push myself through, I didn’t feel anything at all, or maybe I would feel panic for a split second and then it would subside. This stuff was doing something. 

It really stood out to me when I went to an event this year. I didn’t know what to expect, but I did not expect it to have 100,000 people, that’s for sure. But there I was, in a crowd of 100,000 people, feeling pretty much fine. If you had told me 6 months earlier that I would be doing that, I would have laughed at you. There’s no fucking way. Not only was I there, and tolerating it, I plan to go next year because I had a lot of fun. 

Now, I’m finding everything is a lot easier. I choose to go into stores on purpose now, I can browse around and not feel like I need to run. Basically, I feel like I’m making up for lost time. 

That said, our battles are never a straight line. I can have a day that’s bad, where I need to run from a situation, but I always assess “why did this happen”. Maybe I didn’t eat right, dehydrated, stressed from something else, etc. Most of the time though, I think to myself “hey, you didn’t win that one, next time will be better”. I think this is a big deal because the agoraphobic mind is so easy to dismiss all future instances because of one bad instance. 

To sum this all up: 

1) Spend time focusing on yourself and finding which “tools” work for you. Definitely look into breathing exercises. Breathing is a great tool because you always have it with you. I’ve also had success with carrying water everywhere, and noise canceling headphones/ear buds. 

2) Maybe ask about Buspar, just because it worked for me doesn’t mean it will work for you. Other things I tried included: Paxil, klonopin, Xanax, Valium, ADHD medications, Trintellux, Straterra, and probably others. None of that stuff did anything except create side effects. 

3) Be lenient with yourself. Failing to do something doesn’t mean you’re a failure, or that you’ll always fail, it just means today wasn’t the day. Perspective is huge, see if you can change it. I say, you will never be “cured”, but things can get a lot easier. Agoraphobia is like an addiction to safety. You wouldn’t tell an ex addict that it’s OK to indulge because they’ve been doing well for a year. That fight lasts forever. 

You got this!"

I had started a new job as a preschool teacher a few months ago and had to leave because I was having daily panic attacks and not eating all day. I searched and searched and finally found a job at a small retail store that’s very relaxed. I was honest with my employer though and told them up front I have panic attacks so if I get too stressed they allow me to step out and take a break.

You are dealing with enough and don’t let that add to your anxieties.

I have been off work for 5 months now with debilitating GAD following a health issue and having therapy and medication. I am so sorry for what you are going through. But please please be kind to yourself. No one asks  for a mental illness or makes it happen we are just unfortunate to get it and it takes time to heal and recover. 

I think it’s such a positive step that you want to get back into life and work which to me says you are ready! Will it be scary absolutely, will you have panic attacks probably but look at everything you’ve been through the last two years and survived. Panic attacks suck but they won’t  kill you even though it feels like it  . I second the post about the DARE response book / app too i think this will really help you look at your anxiety and panic attacks differently and get back to living the life you want and deserve. No longer fearing them. 

Is there somewhere you could volunteer to gently get back into a work environment. A kind safe accepting space to build your confidence? Maybe a career  change too into a less stressful
environment too?"

I might have to consider stepping down to part time just so my body can heal. I have faith that you are not resistant to treatment. The drs will not tell you anything about how much food affects your mental health. The nurse looked at me with 2 heads when I told her sugar worsens my inflammation. It is seriously something to look into. Even dentists say there’s a mouth body mind connection.

Edit to add I realized I am gluten intolerant and there’s way more that I’m intolerant to that affects my MH. It’s just snowballing and getting worse."

I was a freaking mess for a long time, just fucking up every great opportunity that came my way because I put extremely high expectations on myself and constantly self-sabotaged myself.

I got to the point where the anxiety after partaking too much lasted upwards of 2-3 days.

I'm happy to report that I've been employed for 2 years as a personal shopper at Walmart and love it.  Its a fun job to have and I've gotten a ton healthier over the past two years as a result of significantly reducing my drinking and walking a ton."

It's much lower stress (you can't really get fired, you won't have performance reviews, all that) and you can do it once a week, once a fortnight, whatever works for you. It's much, much better than just sitting around the house forgetting how to interact with the world.

I work at an organisation that has volunteers and we get a lot who come for mental health reasons. It's a good way to ease yourself back into things. And if you find after a while you're okay with a day or two a week volunteering, you could try for a part time job and see how that goes."

Do I need help? What are your thoughts on my situation?,"Hey all,

For the last 2-3 months, I (18M) have started feeling anxious over everyday activities (heavy breathing, a sense of worry combined with a deep pit feeling in my chest, trouble sleeping—e.g., waking up hours before I am supposed to, being very alert and not able to get back to sleep). Though not socially, per se, I’d say that I am a very extroverted person compared to my peers. Recently, this has gotten worse; for over a month now, I have been worrying about nothing—seriously, nothing at all—yet my mind races, filled with worry and overthinking. My heart rate elevates, I feel overwhelmed, and my throat tightens to the point where I start to gag and feel like I'm going to vomit. These episodes can happen at any point of the day, even at work or while sitting on the couch relaxing, and can last for hours. They have begun to happen much more frequently, which is starting to affect my life. These episodes are more likely to occur when I am in social settings, even if it’s relaxed and I can keep to myself, like at an event where I start to over-worry and gag, which is unusual for me because I would call myself social (although I grew up as an extremely shy kid, but that suddenly went away a few years ago). During these episodes, I have been doing the standard breathing exercises I've seen online. They help somewhat, but still aren't enough for me.

In my personal life, no drastic events have taken place; actually, I’d say life is going very well. I've just finished high school with better-than-expected grades and am on summer break for a few months (I'm in the Southern Hemisphere). I have successfully enrolled in university to pursue a degree I have always wanted to do, without the stress of being able to pay for it either. To be honest, I feel guilty for feeling this way; I have everything going for me with all the opportunities I've been privileged to have while others are suffering more than me.

I have spoken to close friends about what I am going through, and they say I am experiencing standard anxiety symptoms. But what do you think? Should I go to my GP with this? (I have a new doctor I have never seen and I am afraid this will get brushed over (I also would like to keep this private as I feel embrassed to be 'broken' and that I feel like this and I don't want to talk about it with my parents)","Hello... something I've noticed is that my anxiety issues started when I was older. Not saying you are old, you're actually quite young, but your life is starting to get more complicated. Your world is getting bigger and your responsibilities and worries are growing with it.

You just need to do the basics, don't drink too much, eat healthy and stay active. That being said, medication is always a good option if you're unable to cope even when doing everything you're supposed to do for your mental health!"

But I have been to a number of doctors and they have done a number of tests on me and they all say I’m fine. ,"Hello, I'm not sure if your question is if this is normal with anxiety. If that's the question then yes, this all sounds like anxiety symptoms to me. Also at least some of it could be side effects from Zoloft."

How did you give yourself the permission to be anxious?,"I know for me, and many of us anxious folks, one of the biggest triggers to anxiety is the resistance to the anxiety itself.

I've found the DARE method very helpful.

Anxiety medication advice ,"So I was on sertraine for 10 years, it stopped working so the GP switched to citalopram 20mg, but the brain fog was horrendous. I need my wits about me with my work so I switched to taking it at night but it isn't working for me, so I went down to 10mg but I am having random panic attacks regularly and the heart palpations are unreal.
I don't want any valium type meds as I don't wsnt to comatose myself. But does anyone have any advice or recommendations for another SSRI to trial? 
Thanks in advance :) ","Hello, maybe a beta blocker would help?"

These omens and ocd and driving me  anxious,"Okay no kidding I just searched the same thing up cause the same omen thing is happening with me but its more silly like i am reading all motivational stuff about getting into harvard etc  but then i see one post thats says - how to deal with rejection and i start thinking its a sign from the universe that I wont be able to make it. Or if i am writing  my goals and my keyboard hangs it leads me to think I might not be able to accomplish it or atleast not in the first try- Its driving me insane! And the thing is then i spend the entire time convincing myself its not true but what if it is.

 I think it primarily developed because a couple of times something similar happened and the thing i was hoping for didnt happen. Its created this fear in me.  Cause my dad alao said once that he wasn't going to pass some interview cause he saw a piece of paper that said 'Na' and he actually didnt . 

I dont know what to do. I try talking to my parents but they just say stop overthinking, ntg will happen.

I am diagnosed with ocd( for some previous compulsions i got over witha nd then felt i healed but now something else is happening all over again and that  feeling drives me insane) but am not taking any medication cause the doc said it could be happening due to low vit D and B12 levels (which mine were). I have bought the supplements again but am still very unsettled. The doc also said therapy but i didnt like that therapist alot , felt weird and knew i couldnt work with him. 
 I also have no time for therapy sessions cause my schedule is kinda jam packed and my parents dont genuinely believe in it or think i have any issues.
 They only bought me once to cope with some bullying in my prev school earlier this year.
 I feel like i have been caught in this loop of ocd where many months i am fine and a few months I am slowly going insane. Like i am over something and then my brain finds a new thing to obsess over. Any suggestions? ","Haha yeah... ""stop overthinking"" doesn't really work eh? I hear that. My catastrophizing can't be stopped even when someone lays out every single detail as to why I'm not being logical. 

In your situation, I do feel that you must think you're awfully important for the universe to be focusing on you!! Especially over trivial things such as rejection or not accomplishing your goals! I mean this in the kindest way ever. It's just that, the world, the universe is huge. Not any single one of us is important enough for the universe to be delivering us signs over small mundane things. Please don't take offense to this! I just promise that if you do your best and keep on trucking, you may face failure and rejection, but you will absolutely grow and learn from.it. You are going to be fine, I promise. Don't put so much pressure on yourself. You're doing great!"
These omens and ocd and driving me  anxious,"Okay no kidding I just searched the same thing up cause the same omen thing is happening with me but its more silly like i am reading all motivational stuff about getting into harvard etc  but then i see one post thats says - how to deal with rejection and i start thinking its a sign from the universe that I wont be able to make it. Or if i am writing  my goals and my keyboard hangs it leads me to think I might not be able to accomplish it or atleast not in the first try- Its driving me insane!

Too many triggers,"Hi, I was wondering of anyone has dealth with this but for the past few years I have developed several fears. I have been struggling with anxiety for many many years but things have gotten worse. For example, I am terrified of driving so I never go on the interstate. I am also terrified of escalators and elevators. It makes everythibg very difficult for me and I really dont know how to deal with it. I have a counselor and I am in therapy but CBT does not seem to do much. Any advice? ","The only way through it, is through it. It’s almost impossibly hard to do when anxiety and fear are so high - your body is yelling and screaming that you’re in danger - but it’s lying to you. Perhaps you encountered a similar situation earlier in your life or perhaps you lost someone close to you - your body is trying to protect you by sending strong warning signals - it doesn’t know the signals are false!  It’s wild isn’t it?!  I struggle too."

It feels like I'm not gonna make it,"If that's alright I'd like to share my story

For Context, I am a 26 year old Male. 

I've suffered from GAD my whole life, fortunately for me it didn't start to become too prominent until a few years back when I was diagnosed with some unknown stomach related illness (it was anxiety). I couldn't keep down food, and if I did manage my stomach would be in so much pain. Of course this resulted in extreme malnourishment and i lost a very unhealthy amount of weight. Anxiety was on 10 all the time due to the uncertainty of what was going on and just how overall awful i felt. 
I was dealing with this for almost an entire year before we finally understood what was going on. Doc put me on Zoloft and wow did it change my life. I went through your typical 'hell week' of mixed emotions and side effects from starting the sertraline. Then I just kinda woke up one day with... nothing. No anxiety, No fear, no uncomfortable physical symptoms. Just here, vibing. 
I took that as a sign and ran as hard as I could with it. I took back my life after being slaved to my anxiety for almost a year straight of day in and day out suffering. I found a job in a field that I really enjoy. I picked up athletic hobbies, I gained back all that weight I lost, I even got to improve my relationship with my girlfriend. Who is a godsend for her patience in dealing with me and my mental health. In every aspect of my life I was able to improve. 
Sure I'd have the occasional hiccup. I'm aware that I'll never be 'cured' of anxiety. However this felt like the next best thing. Small bouts of anxiety would sprout here and there and if I needed support I knew how to get it and move on. 

This lasted about 2 years. 

I will warn you, this part gets dark. I will be talking about suicidal ideology and health anxiety. 

Middle of this year, I started to notice some irregularities with my mental health. Found myself to be slightly more stressed than I typically would allow myself to be. Shorter distances between my small anxiety bouts and overall just kinda felt like crap. 
I was laying down to go to bed and I was having a bit of anxiety but I didn't bother to worry about it because sleep almost always helps. Then I felt this god awful pain rush through my chest as if I was having a heart attack. I immediately went into fight or flight, all the alarms in my body were going off as if this was a life threatening situation. This induced what I would label as the worst panic attack I've experienced in my life. I was able to rationalize that the chances of this being a life threatening event was very slim however I continued to panic. Uncontrollable shaking, sobbing, hyperventilating, the works. I eventually exhausted myself to the point that I fell asleep. Woke up the next day and immediately I was anxious. More so than I'd ever normally experience. Along with this strange roaming sharp pain in my chest. Naturally, I panicked. This lead my brain to stop rationalizing and I was convinced I was dying. 
Decided to head to the urgent care to get some answers and hopefully some peace of mind. I told them first that I do have an anxiety and panic disorder however I'm having chest pains that I've never experienced before. They took me very seriously which I appreciate and ran an EKG. Everything looked normal except for one little blip, typically they wouldn't even bother to raise an eyebrow over it but they decided to be on the safe side and instructed me to head to the ER so they can run additional tests there. Lol Naturally, I had another panic attack. Calmed down enough to get to the ER where I spent close to 8 hours total. They ran EKGs, Blood Work, and X-rays. Everything came back totally normal with no worries. This gave me a little peace of mind but raised another question. 

What the fuck is wrong with me then? 

For the next week I continued to endure these physical symptoms. Constantly fighting my body's human instinct that 'somethings wrong'  and just overall very anxious. More so than I'd ever typically experience. It was debilitating, I couldn't function. Every basic task felt like a mountain to climb and would almost always lead to panic. I had to be totally stimulated by tv, reading, video games, something HAD to be distracting me just so I'd feel slightly better. 
It got bad enough that I couldn't work. Every waking second was hell for me. Luckily I had FMLA time at work so I took that and applied for short term leave. 
In the mean time I went back to my normal doctor and explained what was going on. He wanted to give me an 'oh shit' medication like Ativan or Xanax however I declined, I explained that im constantly struggling and sedating me 24/7 is no way to live. He agreed and decided to increase my Zoloft and prescribed me Buspirone to take daily and nightly to attempt to curb some of those more 'physical' feelings I've been experiencing. Along with Hydroxyzine as a more tame 'oh shit' medication. 
Starting the new medication was easy, no side effects or anything just takes time to build up in my system. However I was still struggling. Every day I was an anxious mess. I basically lived at my computer because it seemed to be the only thing keeping me from being in a constant spiral. I would stay at my desk from the moment I woke up until I would get so tired I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore and I'd go crawl into bed. My girlfriend thankfully would make sure I eat and occasionally force me to go get some sunlight by taking a small walk with the dog. 
I continued this routine for about 2 months. Some days would be better than others, but not often. Eventually work decided they weren't going to approve my leave any longer and I was required to go back. This was hard but I knew that what I was doing wasn't healthy either. It took a good week or two but I finally caught the groove of things and was able to work with my anxiety. The physical symptoms got less and less prominent and I was starting to make some promising progress. 

This leads me to today. Over the past three weeks it's worse than it's ever been. All the previous things i typically experience started back up and more. I've been having new physical symptoms like hotness in my chest, sharp pains over my entire body, palpitations, my heart is constantly beating out of my chest,  or at least it feels that way. My stomach is in shambles all the time and I feel like I have a frog in my throat the refuses to go away. The problem is that it's constant. Never ending. I'm so exhausted from fighting myself all the time. Having to constantly give myself affirmation that I'm okay and it's just anxiety. All of my coping mechanisms are failing, I can't get myself to go to sleep. Eventually when I do get to sleep I stay down for 12+ hours because if I get up I have to deal with all the other symptoms I experience because of this godforsaken anxiety. I'm having daily panic attacks and I'm at my limit. I can't live like this. I'm not even living at this point. I'm just struggling to survive every single day. It genuinely feels like I'm dying. 
I'm not suicidal, at least I don't think I am. It's just so unbearably hard to live right now. With everything I'm experiencing and the trama of it all is just insane. I just want some level of normal back in my life and it's hard to see the light on the other side. I'm trying my best and I know Eventually I'll get there. It's just so hard. 

I'm starting a new medication tonight. Desvenlafaxine, or pristiq depending who you ask. This is gonna replace my zoloft. I'm just really really hoping this breaks this loop I've been stuck in. I'm ready to get back to living. Not whatever this is... 

Thanks for listening, I'd love to hear advice or your story too. I get how hard it is. Truly ♡ 

Much love and good luck to anyone else out there struggling. ","I would take the Xanax or Klonopin .  It will chill you out, just only use it for emergencies."

Much love and good luck to anyone else out there struggling. ","As someone else mentioned, you definitely want to just accept its anxiety. I’ve recently gone through something very similar to your situation, and it took me two months to finally get a grip. I’ve gotten myself from severe anxiety every single day (cold/clammy hands and feet, crazy heart rate spikes, blood pressure increases, headaches, nausea, and an itchy rash that would mostly be there when I woke up and disappear within 10 minutes). 
My situation was triggered from moving 2000 miles from everything I’ve ever known and just forcing myself to be brave and tough, and I was working a very stressful job that ended up firing me. The stress rash started before the firing, and then the panic attacks came after. 
I did all the blood work, saw a dermatologist, got with a Telehealth psychiatrist, and just trying to track down what was wrong with me.   

But people would say it’s stress, it’s anxiety, and I’d say no this is something else. I wouldn’t feel or perceive being stressed in my thoughts or mind, but I had all sorts of physical symptoms. It was bizarre. Like my mind and body aren’t on the same page.   

I was prescribed Zoloft, but once it arrived, I decided not to take it because I remembered it being prescribed to me when I was 19 (I’m 38 now) and it put me into a suicidal state. And I rationalized, “why would I need to be on a drug that I can’t get off of easily just because of some tough shit that happened in my life?” I’m sure there’s psychiatrists that truly want to help, but they also just need to sell a drug and I’ve not met one that goes out of their way to truly give you individual consolation.  

But the change for came in two things 1) Accept it’s anxiety. Tell yourself “this is anxiety. This is stress. I must do non stressful things and find ways to relax. You will have to maintain that for a period of time before the fight or flight truly starts to calm down. Breathing techniques, like inhaling for 4 seconds, pause, exhale 4 seconds, pause, repeat, will help in those moments where your breathing is off and heart rate feels up.   

2) Control OCD tendencies. I was constantly using my thermometer to check my temp, using a blood pressure device, checking my pulse, etc. I’d do it every time I started feeling weird. It took a few days to get myself to completely stop, but I put all the components away and out of my sight, and if I felt something weird, I forced myself not to check anything out. This was very vital, as every time you do these things, you’re empowering the anxiety. You’re not accepting the anxiety, you’re making it about something else. Your brain needs multiple days to recognize that there isn’t a threat.  

I eventually went from having severe anxiety throughout the day to just small periods, and then it became moderate anxiety, and now I just have some trouble falling asleep at night, and every once in awhile I just get anxious in general. 

My shit started in August, wrecked me most of September, I got a little better at the end of October, and by now I feel I’m getting closer to my normal self. 

Be patient with yourself, and above all, be positive with yourself. Pray a little, even if you don’t believe in those things, it’s the power of wanting to strengthen yourself and find positivity that does wonders."

Eventually work decided they weren't going to approve my leave any longer and I was required to go back. This was hard but I knew that what I was doing wasn't healthy either. It took a good week or two but I finally caught the groove of things and was able to work with my anxiety. The physical symptoms got less and less prominent and I was starting to make some promising progress. 

This leads me to today. Over the past three weeks it's worse than it's ever been. All the previous things i typically experience started back up and more. I've been having new physical symptoms like hotness in my chest, sharp pains over my entire body, palpitations, my heart is constantly beating out of my chest,  or at least it feels that way. My stomach is in shambles all the time and I feel like I have a frog in my throat the refuses to go away. The problem is that it's constant. Never ending. I'm so exhausted from fighting myself all the time. Having to constantly give myself affirmation that I'm okay and it's just anxiety. All of my coping mechanisms are failing, I can't get myself to go to sleep. Eventually when I do get to sleep I stay down for 12+ hours because if I get up I have to deal with all the other symptoms I experience because of this godforsaken anxiety. I'm having daily panic attacks and I'm at my limit. I can't live like this. I'm not even living at this point. I'm just struggling to survive every single day. It genuinely feels like I'm dying. 
I'm not suicidal, at least I don't think I am. It's just so unbearably hard to live right now. With everything I'm experiencing and the trama of it all is just insane. I just want some level of normal back in my life and it's hard to see the light on the other side. I'm trying my best and I know Eventually I'll get there. It's just so hard. 

I'm starting a new medication tonight. Desvenlafaxine, or pristiq depending who you ask. This is gonna replace my zoloft. I'm just really really hoping this breaks this loop I've been stuck in. I'm ready to get back to living. Not whatever this is... 

Thanks for listening, I'd love to hear advice or your story too. I get how hard it is. Truly ♡ 

Much love and good luck to anyone else out there struggling. ","I had a sudden onset of anxiety and panic attacks that came out of nowhere and kept getting worse and worse. I eventually went to a psychiatrist, who prescribed me strong SSRIs, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines to take daily for a month due to how severe my anxiety was. However, I decided not to take any of the medications except Xanax for emergencies. Instead, I chose to handle everything on my own and started learning coping strategies.

I began seeing very slight progress, but I was still panicking multiple times a day, with my anxiety at an all-time high. Eventually, I decided to visit a gastroenterologist. After some blood work, I was diagnosed with celiac disease and H. pylori. An endoscopy revealed significant damage to my gut, indicating that I had been dealing with celiac disease for a long time without physical symptoms. I immediately went gluten-free and took antibiotics to treat the H. pylori.

At the height of everything, I experienced severe depressive episodes, which thankfully faded over time. Now, three months later, I’m not 100% back to normal, but my life is much better. My anxiety is manageable, and I’m no longer dealing with depressive episodes. However, I still struggle with derealization and some anxiety, brain fog …

I don’t believe gluten was the sole cause of my issues. I suspect I also have HPPD, which has contributed to my symptoms. Still, gluten clearly played a major role in exacerbating everything. All my symptoms were psychological.

You can pm me if you want to talk abou it ❤️"
It feels like I'm not gonna make it,"If that's alright I'd like to share my story

For Context, I am a 26 year old Male. 

I've suffered from GAD my whole life, fortunately for me it didn't start to become too prominent until a few years back when I was diagnosed with some unknown stomach related illness (it was anxiety). I couldn't keep down food, and if I did manage my stomach would be in so much pain. Of course this resulted in extreme malnourishment and i lost a very unhealthy amount of weight. Anxiety was on 10 all the time due to the uncertainty of what was going on and just how overall awful i felt. 
I was dealing with this for almost an entire year before we finally understood what was going on. Doc put me on Zoloft and wow did it change my life. I went through your typical 'hell week' of mixed emotions and side effects from starting the sertraline. Then I just kinda woke up one day with... nothing. No anxiety, No fear, no uncomfortable physical symptoms. Just here, vibing. 
I took that as a sign and ran as hard as I could with it. I took back my life after being slaved to my anxiety for almost a year straight of day in and day out suffering. I found a job in a field that I really enjoy. I picked up athletic hobbies, I gained back all that weight I lost, I even got to improve my relationship with my girlfriend. Who is a godsend for her patience in dealing with me and my mental health. In every aspect of my life I was able to improve. 
Sure I'd have the occasional hiccup. I'm aware that I'll never be 'cured' of anxiety. However this felt like the next best thing. Small bouts of anxiety would sprout here and there and if I needed support I knew how to get it and move on. 

This lasted about 2 years. 

I will warn you, this part gets dark. I will be talking about suicidal ideology and health anxiety. 

Middle of this year, I started to notice some irregularities with my mental health. Found myself to be slightly more stressed than I typically would allow myself to be. Shorter distances between my small anxiety bouts and overall just kinda felt like crap. 
I was laying down to go to bed and I was having a bit of anxiety but I didn't bother to worry about it because sleep almost always helps. Then I felt this god awful pain rush through my chest as if I was having a heart attack. I immediately went into fight or flight, all the alarms in my body were going off as if this was a life threatening situation. This induced what I would label as the worst panic attack I've experienced in my life. I was able to rationalize that the chances of this being a life threatening event was very slim however I continued to panic. Uncontrollable shaking, sobbing, hyperventilating, the works. I eventually exhausted myself to the point that I fell asleep. Woke up the next day and immediately I was anxious. More so than I'd ever normally experience. Along with this strange roaming sharp pain in my chest. Naturally, I panicked. This lead my brain to stop rationalizing and I was convinced I was dying. 
Decided to head to the urgent care to get some answers and hopefully some peace of mind. I told them first that I do have an anxiety and panic disorder however I'm having chest pains that I've never experienced before. They took me very seriously which I appreciate and ran an EKG. Everything looked normal except for one little blip, typically they wouldn't even bother to raise an eyebrow over it but they decided to be on the safe side and instructed me to head to the ER so they can run additional tests there. Lol Naturally, I had another panic attack. Calmed down enough to get to the ER where I spent close to 8 hours total. They ran EKGs, Blood Work, and X-rays. Everything came back totally normal with no worries. This gave me a little peace of mind but raised another question. 

What the fuck is wrong with me then? 

For the next week I continued to endure these physical symptoms. Constantly fighting my body's human instinct that 'somethings wrong'  and just overall very anxious. More so than I'd ever typically experience. It was debilitating, I couldn't function. Every basic task felt like a mountain to climb and would almost always lead to panic. I had to be totally stimulated by tv, reading, video games, something HAD to be distracting me just so I'd feel slightly better. 
It got bad enough that I couldn't work. Every waking second was hell for me. Luckily I had FMLA time at work so I took that and applied for short term leave. 
In the mean time I went back to my normal doctor and explained what was going on. He wanted to give me an 'oh shit' medication like Ativan or Xanax however I declined, I explained that im constantly struggling and sedating me 24/7 is no way to live. He agreed and decided to increase my Zoloft and prescribed me Buspirone to take daily and nightly to attempt to curb some of those more 'physical' feelings I've been experiencing. Along with Hydroxyzine as a more tame 'oh shit' medication. 
Starting the new medication was easy, no side effects or anything just takes time to build up in my system. However I was still struggling. Every day I was an anxious mess. I basically lived at my computer because it seemed to be the only thing keeping me from being in a constant spiral. I would stay at my desk from the moment I woke up until I would get so tired I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore and I'd go crawl into bed. My girlfriend thankfully would make sure I eat and occasionally force me to go get some sunlight by taking a small walk with the dog.

Much love and good luck to anyone else out there struggling. ","I live in fight or flight mode and I have a hard time leaning on meds (addiction runs in the family and my brain won’t let me even if it helps) and Propanol is the only anti anxiety med that I can get myself to take and it helps me a lot. I think it’s a blood pressure medication but they use it off label for anxiety. It’s also an adrenaline blocker. Just something to look into for you! 

I also use the app Finch! It’s like a little animal that you take care of by setting daily goals for yourself ‘drink water’ ‘shower’.. it helped me cause I have a hard time with the self care we anxious folks desperately need! 
Anxiety is a bitch, and us strangers on the interwebs will be an ear if you ever need one! YOU ARE STRONG. YOU ARE SMART. YOU ARE KIND. AND YOU MATTER! <3"

Unless you wake up and fear normal everyday things such as work, school, relationships. If when you wake up you think “I’m dying and I need to see a doctor” that’s health anxiety. Which is highly treatable"

Along with Hydroxyzine as a more tame 'oh shit' medication. 
Starting the new medication was easy, no side effects or anything just takes time to build up in my system. However I was still struggling. Every day I was an anxious mess. I basically lived at my computer because it seemed to be the only thing keeping me from being in a constant spiral. I would stay at my desk from the moment I woke up until I would get so tired I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore and I'd go crawl into bed. My girlfriend thankfully would make sure I eat and occasionally force me to go get some sunlight by taking a small walk with the dog. 
I continued this routine for about 2 months. Some days would be better than others, but not often. Eventually work decided they weren't going to approve my leave any longer and I was required to go back. This was hard but I knew that what I was doing wasn't healthy either. It took a good week or two but I finally caught the groove of things and was able to work with my anxiety. The physical symptoms got less and less prominent and I was starting to make some promising progress. 

This leads me to today. Over the past three weeks it's worse than it's ever been. All the previous things i typically experience started back up and more. I've been having new physical symptoms like hotness in my chest, sharp pains over my entire body, palpitations, my heart is constantly beating out of my chest,  or at least it feels that way. My stomach is in shambles all the time and I feel like I have a frog in my throat the refuses to go away. The problem is that it's constant. Never ending. I'm so exhausted from fighting myself all the time. Having to constantly give myself affirmation that I'm okay and it's just anxiety. All of my coping mechanisms are failing, I can't get myself to go to sleep. Eventually when I do get to sleep I stay down for 12+ hours because if I get up I have to deal with all the other symptoms I experience because of this godforsaken anxiety. I'm having daily panic attacks and I'm at my limit. I can't live like this. I'm not even living at this point. I'm just struggling to survive every single day. It genuinely feels like I'm dying. 
I'm not suicidal, at least I don't think I am. It's just so unbearably hard to live right now. With everything I'm experiencing and the trama of it all is just insane. I just want some level of normal back in my life and it's hard to see the light on the other side. I'm trying my best and I know Eventually I'll get there. It's just so hard. 

I'm starting a new medication tonight. Desvenlafaxine, or pristiq depending who you ask. This is gonna replace my zoloft. I'm just really really hoping this breaks this loop I've been stuck in. I'm ready to get back to living. Not whatever this is... 

Thanks for listening, I'd love to hear advice or your story too. I get how hard it is. Truly ♡ 

Much love and good luck to anyone else out there struggling. ","I’m so sorry you’re going through this. It sucks and it’s not easy. I started Pristiq almost a month ago and I feel so much better. I wouldn’t say my physical symptoms were that bad but I was having whole body shakes at night, I couldn’t even go to work without bursting into tears. I almost got to the point where I didn’t want to live like this anymore and just end it all but I have so much support around me and now I feel soo much better. I take 5mg of melatonin and 25mg of Hydroxyzine before bed. I’ve never slept better.
I’m sending all my thoughts and love to you! It will get better!"
It feels like I'm not gonna make it,"If that's alright I'd like to share my story

For Context, I am a 26 year old Male. 

I've suffered from GAD my whole life, fortunately for me it didn't start to become too prominent until a few years back when I was diagnosed with some unknown stomach related illness (it was anxiety). I couldn't keep down food, and if I did manage my stomach would be in so much pain. Of course this resulted in extreme malnourishment and i lost a very unhealthy amount of weight. Anxiety was on 10 all the time due to the uncertainty of what was going on and just how overall awful i felt. 
I was dealing with this for almost an entire year before we finally understood what was going on. Doc put me on Zoloft and wow did it change my life. I went through your typical 'hell week' of mixed emotions and side effects from starting the sertraline. Then I just kinda woke up one day with... nothing. No anxiety, No fear, no uncomfortable physical symptoms. Just here, vibing. 
I took that as a sign and ran as hard as I could with it. I took back my life after being slaved to my anxiety for almost a year straight of day in and day out suffering. I found a job in a field that I really enjoy. I picked up athletic hobbies, I gained back all that weight I lost, I even got to improve my relationship with my girlfriend. Who is a godsend for her patience in dealing with me and my mental health. In every aspect of my life I was able to improve. 
Sure I'd have the occasional hiccup. I'm aware that I'll never be 'cured' of anxiety. However this felt like the next best thing. Small bouts of anxiety would sprout here and there and if I needed support I knew how to get it and move on. 

This lasted about 2 years. 

I will warn you, this part gets dark. I will be talking about suicidal ideology and health anxiety. 

Middle of this year, I started to notice some irregularities with my mental health. Found myself to be slightly more stressed than I typically would allow myself to be. Shorter distances between my small anxiety bouts and overall just kinda felt like crap. 
I was laying down to go to bed and I was having a bit of anxiety but I didn't bother to worry about it because sleep almost always helps. Then I felt this god awful pain rush through my chest as if I was having a heart attack. I immediately went into fight or flight, all the alarms in my body were going off as if this was a life threatening situation. This induced what I would label as the worst panic attack I've experienced in my life. I was able to rationalize that the chances of this being a life threatening event was very slim however I continued to panic. Uncontrollable shaking, sobbing, hyperventilating, the works. I eventually exhausted myself to the point that I fell asleep. Woke up the next day and immediately I was anxious. More so than I'd ever normally experience. Along with this strange roaming sharp pain in my chest. Naturally, I panicked. This lead my brain to stop rationalizing and I was convinced I was dying. 
Decided to head to the urgent care to get some answers and hopefully some peace of mind. I told them first that I do have an anxiety and panic disorder however I'm having chest pains that I've never experienced before. They took me very seriously which I appreciate and ran an EKG. Everything looked normal except for one little blip, typically they wouldn't even bother to raise an eyebrow over it but they decided to be on the safe side and instructed me to head to the ER so they can run additional tests there. Lol Naturally, I had another panic attack. Calmed down enough to get to the ER where I spent close to 8 hours total. They ran EKGs, Blood Work, and X-rays. Everything came back totally normal with no worries. This gave me a little peace of mind but raised another question. 

What the fuck is wrong with me then? 

For the next week I continued to endure these physical symptoms. Constantly fighting my body's human instinct that 'somethings wrong'  and just overall very anxious. More so than I'd ever typically experience. It was debilitating, I couldn't function. Every basic task felt like a mountain to climb and would almost always lead to panic. I had to be totally stimulated by tv, reading, video games, something HAD to be distracting me just so I'd feel slightly better. 
It got bad enough that I couldn't work. Every waking second was hell for me. Luckily I had FMLA time at work so I took that and applied for short term leave. 
In the mean time I went back to my normal doctor and explained what was going on. He wanted to give me an 'oh shit' medication like Ativan or Xanax however I declined, I explained that im constantly struggling and sedating me 24/7 is no way to live. He agreed and decided to increase my Zoloft and prescribed me Buspirone to take daily and nightly to attempt to curb some of those more 'physical' feelings I've been experiencing. Along with Hydroxyzine as a more tame 'oh shit' medication.

Much love and good luck to anyone else out there struggling. ","Wow I totally relate to everything your saying and going through a similar situation at the moment. Someone else already suggested, but it seems like you have more health anxiety/panic disorder over GAD, or perhaps you are struggling more so right now with health anxiety over GAD becasue of the many physical symptoms. I am guilty of this but you are feeding your anxiety by ‘checking’ your HR and paying attention to the physical symptoms. I get a twinge and suddenly from 0 - 100, I think something is wrong and my recent anxiety has been massively influenced by a bad panic attack, I literally hadn’t had one in YEARS before that and ever since I completely spiralled. I’ve recently started practicing the difference between paying attention vs awareness to physical symptoms and that has helped. Read up on it - it’s actually a practice taught in OCD but health anxiety can overlap with OCD. I acknowledge my awareness of a  symptom, but so not give it any more thought or consideration and continue with whatever it was that I was doing. I’m still practicing it but it’s helping! 

I am also currently trialling different medication, tried sertraline, now trying fluoxetine(starting tomorrow and terrified!). Although you’re in a difficult situation now, look how well you were doing when medication WAS working for you. That proves that you WILL be able to get out of this weird period of your anxiety and it WILL get better, medication can help and it’s a unfortunate case of trial and error and patience but it’s really positive to read how well you responded to previous meds.

I have no practical tips as I am going through the same thing. But one thing I have learnt about myself though is to stop trying to avoid doing things. My safety behaviour is to avoid going out and ‘living’ really. It makes me depressed and feeds into my anxiety and the whole thing is a vicious circle and I can very easily can get agoraphobic. I am now taking small walks, going out for coffee and started volunteering in my community and while it’s not a miracle cure, it does make me feel somewhat better getting out. 

One thing that really keeps me going (and trust me I’ve also felt some of the darker things you mentioned in your post) is that anxiety comes in peaks and flows. Literally a few months ago I was high functioning, busy, able to be independent etc, and now I’m not. But with time, patience and work, things will improve. Wish you be the best of luck with your new medication and hoping that helps!"

Everything looked normal except for one little blip, typically they wouldn't even bother to raise an eyebrow over it but they decided to be on the safe side and instructed me to head to the ER so they can run additional tests there. Lol Naturally, I had another panic attack. Calmed down enough to get to the ER where I spent close to 8 hours total. They ran EKGs, Blood Work, and X-rays. Everything came back totally normal with no worries. This gave me a little peace of mind but raised another question. 

What the fuck is wrong with me then? 

For the next week I continued to endure these physical symptoms. Constantly fighting my body's human instinct that 'somethings wrong'  and just overall very anxious. More so than I'd ever typically experience. It was debilitating, I couldn't function. Every basic task felt like a mountain to climb and would almost always lead to panic. I had to be totally stimulated by tv, reading, video games, something HAD to be distracting me just so I'd feel slightly better. 
It got bad enough that I couldn't work. Every waking second was hell for me. Luckily I had FMLA time at work so I took that and applied for short term leave. 
In the mean time I went back to my normal doctor and explained what was going on. He wanted to give me an 'oh shit' medication like Ativan or Xanax however I declined, I explained that im constantly struggling and sedating me 24/7 is no way to live. He agreed and decided to increase my Zoloft and prescribed me Buspirone to take daily and nightly to attempt to curb some of those more 'physical' feelings I've been experiencing. Along with Hydroxyzine as a more tame 'oh shit' medication. 
Starting the new medication was easy, no side effects or anything just takes time to build up in my system. However I was still struggling. Every day I was an anxious mess. I basically lived at my computer because it seemed to be the only thing keeping me from being in a constant spiral. I would stay at my desk from the moment I woke up until I would get so tired I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore and I'd go crawl into bed. My girlfriend thankfully would make sure I eat and occasionally force me to go get some sunlight by taking a small walk with the dog. 
I continued this routine for about 2 months. Some days would be better than others, but not often. Eventually work decided they weren't going to approve my leave any longer and I was required to go back. This was hard but I knew that what I was doing wasn't healthy either. It took a good week or two but I finally caught the groove of things and was able to work with my anxiety. The physical symptoms got less and less prominent and I was starting to make some promising progress. 

This leads me to today. Over the past three weeks it's worse than it's ever been. All the previous things i typically experience started back up and more. I've been having new physical symptoms like hotness in my chest, sharp pains over my entire body, palpitations, my heart is constantly beating out of my chest,  or at least it feels that way. My stomach is in shambles all the time and I feel like I have a frog in my throat the refuses to go away. The problem is that it's constant. Never ending. I'm so exhausted from fighting myself all the time. Having to constantly give myself affirmation that I'm okay and it's just anxiety. All of my coping mechanisms are failing, I can't get myself to go to sleep. Eventually when I do get to sleep I stay down for 12+ hours because if I get up I have to deal with all the other symptoms I experience because of this godforsaken anxiety. I'm having daily panic attacks and I'm at my limit. I can't live like this. I'm not even living at this point. I'm just struggling to survive every single day. It genuinely feels like I'm dying. 
I'm not suicidal, at least I don't think I am. It's just so unbearably hard to live right now. With everything I'm experiencing and the trama of it all is just insane. I just want some level of normal back in my life and it's hard to see the light on the other side. I'm trying my best and I know Eventually I'll get there. It's just so hard. 

I'm starting a new medication tonight. Desvenlafaxine, or pristiq depending who you ask. This is gonna replace my zoloft. I'm just really really hoping this breaks this loop I've been stuck in. I'm ready to get back to living. Not whatever this is... 

Thanks for listening, I'd love to hear advice or your story too. I get how hard it is. Truly ♡ 

Much love and good luck to anyone else out there struggling. ",I like the idea of an emergency medication when things get really rough but I have an addictive personality and my main worry is that I'll become to reliant on something like those.

For Context, I am a 26 year old Male. 

I've suffered from GAD my whole life, fortunately for me it didn't start to become too prominent until a few years back when I was diagnosed with some unknown stomach related illness (it was anxiety). I couldn't keep down food, and if I did manage my stomach would be in so much pain. Of course this resulted in extreme malnourishment and i lost a very unhealthy amount of weight. Anxiety was on 10 all the time due to the uncertainty of what was going on and just how overall awful i felt. 
I was dealing with this for almost an entire year before we finally understood what was going on. Doc put me on Zoloft and wow did it change my life. I went through your typical 'hell week' of mixed emotions and side effects from starting the sertraline. Then I just kinda woke up one day with... nothing. No anxiety, No fear, no uncomfortable physical symptoms. Just here, vibing. 
I took that as a sign and ran as hard as I could with it. I took back my life after being slaved to my anxiety for almost a year straight of day in and day out suffering. I found a job in a field that I really enjoy. I picked up athletic hobbies, I gained back all that weight I lost, I even got to improve my relationship with my girlfriend. Who is a godsend for her patience in dealing with me and my mental health. In every aspect of my life I was able to improve. 
Sure I'd have the occasional hiccup. I'm aware that I'll never be 'cured' of anxiety. However this felt like the next best thing. Small bouts of anxiety would sprout here and there and if I needed support I knew how to get it and move on. 

This lasted about 2 years. 

I will warn you, this part gets dark. I will be talking about suicidal ideology and health anxiety. 

Middle of this year, I started to notice some irregularities with my mental health. Found myself to be slightly more stressed than I typically would allow myself to be. Shorter distances between my small anxiety bouts and overall just kinda felt like crap. 
I was laying down to go to bed and I was having a bit of anxiety but I didn't bother to worry about it because sleep almost always helps. Then I felt this god awful pain rush through my chest as if I was having a heart attack. I immediately went into fight or flight, all the alarms in my body were going off as if this was a life threatening situation. This induced what I would label as the worst panic attack I've experienced in my life. I was able to rationalize that the chances of this being a life threatening event was very slim however I continued to panic. Uncontrollable shaking, sobbing, hyperventilating, the works. I eventually exhausted myself to the point that I fell asleep. Woke up the next day and immediately I was anxious. More so than I'd ever normally experience. Along with this strange roaming sharp pain in my chest. Naturally, I panicked. This lead my brain to stop rationalizing and I was convinced I was dying.

It is interesting explaining it to people that im not stressed out or 'overthinking' to cause my anxiety. It's refreshing to hear a similar story.

More so than I'd ever typically experience. It was debilitating, I couldn't function. Every basic task felt like a mountain to climb and would almost always lead to panic. I had to be totally stimulated by tv, reading, video games, something HAD to be distracting me just so I'd feel slightly better. 
It got bad enough that I couldn't work. Every waking second was hell for me. Luckily I had FMLA time at work so I took that and applied for short term leave. 
In the mean time I went back to my normal doctor and explained what was going on. He wanted to give me an 'oh shit' medication like Ativan or Xanax however I declined, I explained that im constantly struggling and sedating me 24/7 is no way to live. He agreed and decided to increase my Zoloft and prescribed me Buspirone to take daily and nightly to attempt to curb some of those more 'physical' feelings I've been experiencing. Along with Hydroxyzine as a more tame 'oh shit' medication. 
Starting the new medication was easy, no side effects or anything just takes time to build up in my system. However I was still struggling. Every day I was an anxious mess. I basically lived at my computer because it seemed to be the only thing keeping me from being in a constant spiral. I would stay at my desk from the moment I woke up until I would get so tired I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore and I'd go crawl into bed. My girlfriend thankfully would make sure I eat and occasionally force me to go get some sunlight by taking a small walk with the dog. 
I continued this routine for about 2 months. Some days would be better than others, but not often. Eventually work decided they weren't going to approve my leave any longer and I was required to go back. This was hard but I knew that what I was doing wasn't healthy either. It took a good week or two but I finally caught the groove of things and was able to work with my anxiety. The physical symptoms got less and less prominent and I was starting to make some promising progress. 

This leads me to today. Over the past three weeks it's worse than it's ever been. All the previous things i typically experience started back up and more. I've been having new physical symptoms like hotness in my chest, sharp pains over my entire body, palpitations, my heart is constantly beating out of my chest,  or at least it feels that way. My stomach is in shambles all the time and I feel like I have a frog in my throat the refuses to go away. The problem is that it's constant. Never ending. I'm so exhausted from fighting myself all the time. Having to constantly give myself affirmation that I'm okay and it's just anxiety. All of my coping mechanisms are failing, I can't get myself to go to sleep. Eventually when I do get to sleep I stay down for 12+ hours because if I get up I have to deal with all the other symptoms I experience because of this godforsaken anxiety. I'm having daily panic attacks and I'm at my limit. I can't live like this. I'm not even living at this point. I'm just struggling to survive every single day. It genuinely feels like I'm dying. 
I'm not suicidal, at least I don't think I am. It's just so unbearably hard to live right now. With everything I'm experiencing and the trama of it all is just insane. I just want some level of normal back in my life and it's hard to see the light on the other side. I'm trying my best and I know Eventually I'll get there. It's just so hard. 

I'm starting a new medication tonight. Desvenlafaxine, or pristiq depending who you ask. This is gonna replace my zoloft. I'm just really really hoping this breaks this loop I've been stuck in. I'm ready to get back to living. Not whatever this is... 

Thanks for listening, I'd love to hear advice or your story too. I get how hard it is. Truly ♡ 

Much love and good luck to anyone else out there struggling. ",Definitely something to talk to my doctor about. Thanks for the info
It feels like I'm not gonna make it,"If that's alright I'd like to share my story

For Context, I am a 26 year old Male. 

I've suffered from GAD my whole life, fortunately for me it didn't start to become too prominent until a few years back when I was diagnosed with some unknown stomach related illness (it was anxiety). I couldn't keep down food, and if I did manage my stomach would be in so much pain. Of course this resulted in extreme malnourishment and i lost a very unhealthy amount of weight. Anxiety was on 10 all the time due to the uncertainty of what was going on and just how overall awful i felt. 
I was dealing with this for almost an entire year before we finally understood what was going on. Doc put me on Zoloft and wow did it change my life. I went through your typical 'hell week' of mixed emotions and side effects from starting the sertraline. Then I just kinda woke up one day with... nothing. No anxiety, No fear, no uncomfortable physical symptoms. Just here, vibing. 
I took that as a sign and ran as hard as I could with it. I took back my life after being slaved to my anxiety for almost a year straight of day in and day out suffering. I found a job in a field that I really enjoy. I picked up athletic hobbies, I gained back all that weight I lost, I even got to improve my relationship with my girlfriend. Who is a godsend for her patience in dealing with me and my mental health. In every aspect of my life I was able to improve. 
Sure I'd have the occasional hiccup. I'm aware that I'll never be 'cured' of anxiety. However this felt like the next best thing. Small bouts of anxiety would sprout here and there and if I needed support I knew how to get it and move on. 

This lasted about 2 years. 

I will warn you, this part gets dark. I will be talking about suicidal ideology and health anxiety. 

Middle of this year, I started to notice some irregularities with my mental health. Found myself to be slightly more stressed than I typically would allow myself to be. Shorter distances between my small anxiety bouts and overall just kinda felt like crap. 
I was laying down to go to bed and I was having a bit of anxiety but I didn't bother to worry about it because sleep almost always helps. Then I felt this god awful pain rush through my chest as if I was having a heart attack. I immediately went into fight or flight, all the alarms in my body were going off as if this was a life threatening situation. This induced what I would label as the worst panic attack I've experienced in my life. I was able to rationalize that the chances of this being a life threatening event was very slim however I continued to panic. Uncontrollable shaking, sobbing, hyperventilating, the works. I eventually exhausted myself to the point that I fell asleep. Woke up the next day and immediately I was anxious. More so than I'd ever normally experience. Along with this strange roaming sharp pain in my chest. Naturally, I panicked. This lead my brain to stop rationalizing and I was convinced I was dying. 
Decided to head to the urgent care to get some answers and hopefully some peace of mind. I told them first that I do have an anxiety and panic disorder however I'm having chest pains that I've never experienced before. They took me very seriously which I appreciate and ran an EKG. Everything looked normal except for one little blip, typically they wouldn't even bother to raise an eyebrow over it but they decided to be on the safe side and instructed me to head to the ER so they can run additional tests there. Lol Naturally, I had another panic attack. Calmed down enough to get to the ER where I spent close to 8 hours total. They ran EKGs, Blood Work, and X-rays. Everything came back totally normal with no worries. This gave me a little peace of mind but raised another question.

I would stay at my desk from the moment I woke up until I would get so tired I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore and I'd go crawl into bed. My girlfriend thankfully would make sure I eat and occasionally force me to go get some sunlight by taking a small walk with the dog. 
I continued this routine for about 2 months. Some days would be better than others, but not often. Eventually work decided they weren't going to approve my leave any longer and I was required to go back. This was hard but I knew that what I was doing wasn't healthy either. It took a good week or two but I finally caught the groove of things and was able to work with my anxiety. The physical symptoms got less and less prominent and I was starting to make some promising progress. 

This leads me to today. Over the past three weeks it's worse than it's ever been. All the previous things i typically experience started back up and more. I've been having new physical symptoms like hotness in my chest, sharp pains over my entire body, palpitations, my heart is constantly beating out of my chest,  or at least it feels that way. My stomach is in shambles all the time and I feel like I have a frog in my throat the refuses to go away. The problem is that it's constant. Never ending. I'm so exhausted from fighting myself all the time. Having to constantly give myself affirmation that I'm okay and it's just anxiety. All of my coping mechanisms are failing, I can't get myself to go to sleep. Eventually when I do get to sleep I stay down for 12+ hours because if I get up I have to deal with all the other symptoms I experience because of this godforsaken anxiety. I'm having daily panic attacks and I'm at my limit. I can't live like this. I'm not even living at this point. I'm just struggling to survive every single day. It genuinely feels like I'm dying. 
I'm not suicidal, at least I don't think I am. It's just so unbearably hard to live right now. With everything I'm experiencing and the trama of it all is just insane. I just want some level of normal back in my life and it's hard to see the light on the other side. I'm trying my best and I know Eventually I'll get there. It's just so hard. 

I'm starting a new medication tonight. Desvenlafaxine, or pristiq depending who you ask. This is gonna replace my zoloft. I'm just really really hoping this breaks this loop I've been stuck in. I'm ready to get back to living. Not whatever this is... 

Thanks for listening, I'd love to hear advice or your story too. I get how hard it is. Truly ♡ 

Much love and good luck to anyone else out there struggling. ",Thanks so much for sharing your experiences. We relate in alot of ways. I too find myself avoiding life and work when it gets bad. My defense mechanism is to sleep and avoid any and all activities. I'll have to read up more on that Attention vs Awareness thing. Definitely seems like something im struggling with. I like to look back alot on how well performed on Zoloft and it gives me hope. The darker part of me looks at it as something out of my reach but I'm working towards a more positive attitude with it. I'm also very anxious about starting new meds but you and I both seem to be starting new ones today so let's not chicken out and get better ♡ if you need anything let me know and ill do what I can ♡
It feels like I'm not gonna make it,"If that's alright I'd like to share my story

For Context, I am a 26 year old Male. 

I've suffered from GAD my whole life, fortunately for me it didn't start to become too prominent until a few years back when I was diagnosed with some unknown stomach related illness (it was anxiety). I couldn't keep down food, and if I did manage my stomach would be in so much pain. Of course this resulted in extreme malnourishment and i lost a very unhealthy amount of weight. Anxiety was on 10 all the time due to the uncertainty of what was going on and just how overall awful i felt. 
I was dealing with this for almost an entire year before we finally understood what was going on. Doc put me on Zoloft and wow did it change my life. I went through your typical 'hell week' of mixed emotions and side effects from starting the sertraline. Then I just kinda woke up one day with... nothing. No anxiety, No fear, no uncomfortable physical symptoms. Just here, vibing. 
I took that as a sign and ran as hard as I could with it. I took back my life after being slaved to my anxiety for almost a year straight of day in and day out suffering. I found a job in a field that I really enjoy. I picked up athletic hobbies, I gained back all that weight I lost, I even got to improve my relationship with my girlfriend. Who is a godsend for her patience in dealing with me and my mental health. In every aspect of my life I was able to improve. 
Sure I'd have the occasional hiccup. I'm aware that I'll never be 'cured' of anxiety. However this felt like the next best thing. Small bouts of anxiety would sprout here and there and if I needed support I knew how to get it and move on. 

This lasted about 2 years. 

I will warn you, this part gets dark. I will be talking about suicidal ideology and health anxiety. 

Middle of this year, I started to notice some irregularities with my mental health. Found myself to be slightly more stressed than I typically would allow myself to be. Shorter distances between my small anxiety bouts and overall just kinda felt like crap. 
I was laying down to go to bed and I was having a bit of anxiety but I didn't bother to worry about it because sleep almost always helps. Then I felt this god awful pain rush through my chest as if I was having a heart attack. I immediately went into fight or flight, all the alarms in my body were going off as if this was a life threatening situation. This induced what I would label as the worst panic attack I've experienced in my life. I was able to rationalize that the chances of this being a life threatening event was very slim however I continued to panic. Uncontrollable shaking, sobbing, hyperventilating, the works. I eventually exhausted myself to the point that I fell asleep. Woke up the next day and immediately I was anxious. More so than I'd ever normally experience. Along with this strange roaming sharp pain in my chest. Naturally, I panicked. This lead my brain to stop rationalizing and I was convinced I was dying. 
Decided to head to the urgent care to get some answers and hopefully some peace of mind. I told them first that I do have an anxiety and panic disorder however I'm having chest pains that I've never experienced before. They took me very seriously which I appreciate and ran an EKG. Everything looked normal except for one little blip, typically they wouldn't even bother to raise an eyebrow over it but they decided to be on the safe side and instructed me to head to the ER so they can run additional tests there. Lol Naturally, I had another panic attack. Calmed down enough to get to the ER where I spent close to 8 hours total. They ran EKGs, Blood Work, and X-rays. Everything came back totally normal with no worries. This gave me a little peace of mind but raised another question. 

What the fuck is wrong with me then? 

For the next week I continued to endure these physical symptoms. Constantly fighting my body's human instinct that 'somethings wrong'  and just overall very anxious. More so than I'd ever typically experience. It was debilitating, I couldn't function. Every basic task felt like a mountain to climb and would almost always lead to panic. I had to be totally stimulated by tv, reading, video games, something HAD to be distracting me just so I'd feel slightly better. 
It got bad enough that I couldn't work. Every waking second was hell for me. Luckily I had FMLA time at work so I took that and applied for short term leave. 
In the mean time I went back to my normal doctor and explained what was going on. He wanted to give me an 'oh shit' medication like Ativan or Xanax however I declined, I explained that im constantly struggling and sedating me 24/7 is no way to live. He agreed and decided to increase my Zoloft and prescribed me Buspirone to take daily and nightly to attempt to curb some of those more 'physical' feelings I've been experiencing. Along with Hydroxyzine as a more tame 'oh shit' medication.

This leads me to today. Over the past three weeks it's worse than it's ever been. All the previous things i typically experience started back up and more. I've been having new physical symptoms like hotness in my chest, sharp pains over my entire body, palpitations, my heart is constantly beating out of my chest,  or at least it feels that way. My stomach is in shambles all the time and I feel like I have a frog in my throat the refuses to go away. The problem is that it's constant. Never ending. I'm so exhausted from fighting myself all the time. Having to constantly give myself affirmation that I'm okay and it's just anxiety. All of my coping mechanisms are failing, I can't get myself to go to sleep. Eventually when I do get to sleep I stay down for 12+ hours because if I get up I have to deal with all the other symptoms I experience because of this godforsaken anxiety. I'm having daily panic attacks and I'm at my limit. I can't live like this. I'm not even living at this point. I'm just struggling to survive every single day. It genuinely feels like I'm dying. 
I'm not suicidal, at least I don't think I am. It's just so unbearably hard to live right now. With everything I'm experiencing and the trama of it all is just insane. I just want some level of normal back in my life and it's hard to see the light on the other side. I'm trying my best and I know Eventually I'll get there. It's just so hard. 

I'm starting a new medication tonight. Desvenlafaxine, or pristiq depending who you ask. This is gonna replace my zoloft. I'm just really really hoping this breaks this loop I've been stuck in. I'm ready to get back to living. Not whatever this is... 

Thanks for listening, I'd love to hear advice or your story too. I get how hard it is. Truly ♡ 

Much love and good luck to anyone else out there struggling. ","I do have an addictive personality and I’ve been dependent on Xanax for over 20 years, but I can also say that it works great and doesits job well.  You have to look at the risks and the benefits and do the benefits of taking it out weigh the risks of having no life. Yeah you might have a dependency and it is a very bad dependency, but it might also give your life back. AND  these days getting a prescription for that is very rare so if your doctor is offering it, I would definitely take them up for it because finding a doctor willing to prescribe those these days is very very rare. At least you know you’ll have it in case of emergencies , that’s the way you look at it."
It feels like I'm not gonna make it,"If that's alright I'd like to share my story

For Context, I am a 26 year old Male. 

I've suffered from GAD my whole life, fortunately for me it didn't start to become too prominent until a few years back when I was diagnosed with some unknown stomach related illness (it was anxiety). I couldn't keep down food, and if I did manage my stomach would be in so much pain. Of course this resulted in extreme malnourishment and i lost a very unhealthy amount of weight. Anxiety was on 10 all the time due to the uncertainty of what was going on and just how overall awful i felt. 
I was dealing with this for almost an entire year before we finally understood what was going on. Doc put me on Zoloft and wow did it change my life. I went through your typical 'hell week' of mixed emotions and side effects from starting the sertraline. Then I just kinda woke up one day with... nothing. No anxiety, No fear, no uncomfortable physical symptoms. Just here, vibing. 
I took that as a sign and ran as hard as I could with it. I took back my life after being slaved to my anxiety for almost a year straight of day in and day out suffering. I found a job in a field that I really enjoy. I picked up athletic hobbies, I gained back all that weight I lost, I even got to improve my relationship with my girlfriend. Who is a godsend for her patience in dealing with me and my mental health. In every aspect of my life I was able to improve. 
Sure I'd have the occasional hiccup. I'm aware that I'll never be 'cured' of anxiety. However this felt like the next best thing. Small bouts of anxiety would sprout here and there and if I needed support I knew how to get it and move on. 

This lasted about 2 years. 

I will warn you, this part gets dark. I will be talking about suicidal ideology and health anxiety. 

Middle of this year, I started to notice some irregularities with my mental health. Found myself to be slightly more stressed than I typically would allow myself to be. Shorter distances between my small anxiety bouts and overall just kinda felt like crap. 
I was laying down to go to bed and I was having a bit of anxiety but I didn't bother to worry about it because sleep almost always helps. Then I felt this god awful pain rush through my chest as if I was having a heart attack. I immediately went into fight or flight, all the alarms in my body were going off as if this was a life threatening situation. This induced what I would label as the worst panic attack I've experienced in my life. I was able to rationalize that the chances of this being a life threatening event was very slim however I continued to panic. Uncontrollable shaking, sobbing, hyperventilating, the works. I eventually exhausted myself to the point that I fell asleep. Woke up the next day and immediately I was anxious. More so than I'd ever normally experience. Along with this strange roaming sharp pain in my chest. Naturally, I panicked. This lead my brain to stop rationalizing and I was convinced I was dying. 
Decided to head to the urgent care to get some answers and hopefully some peace of mind. I told them first that I do have an anxiety and panic disorder however I'm having chest pains that I've never experienced before. They took me very seriously which I appreciate and ran an EKG. Everything looked normal except for one little blip, typically they wouldn't even bother to raise an eyebrow over it but they decided to be on the safe side and instructed me to head to the ER so they can run additional tests there. Lol Naturally, I had another panic attack. Calmed down enough to get to the ER where I spent close to 8 hours total. They ran EKGs, Blood Work, and X-rays. Everything came back totally normal with no worries. This gave me a little peace of mind but raised another question. 

What the fuck is wrong with me then? 

For the next week I continued to endure these physical symptoms. Constantly fighting my body's human instinct that 'somethings wrong'  and just overall very anxious. More so than I'd ever typically experience. It was debilitating, I couldn't function. Every basic task felt like a mountain to climb and would almost always lead to panic. I had to be totally stimulated by tv, reading, video games, something HAD to be distracting me just so I'd feel slightly better. 
It got bad enough that I couldn't work. Every waking second was hell for me. Luckily I had FMLA time at work so I took that and applied for short term leave. 
In the mean time I went back to my normal doctor and explained what was going on. He wanted to give me an 'oh shit' medication like Ativan or Xanax however I declined, I explained that im constantly struggling and sedating me 24/7 is no way to live. He agreed and decided to increase my Zoloft and prescribed me Buspirone to take daily and nightly to attempt to curb some of those more 'physical' feelings I've been experiencing. Along with Hydroxyzine as a more tame 'oh shit' medication. 
Starting the new medication was easy, no side effects or anything just takes time to build up in my system. However I was still struggling. Every day I was an anxious mess. I basically lived at my computer because it seemed to be the only thing keeping me from being in a constant spiral. I would stay at my desk from the moment I woke up until I would get so tired I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore and I'd go crawl into bed. My girlfriend thankfully would make sure I eat and occasionally force me to go get some sunlight by taking a small walk with the dog. 
I continued this routine for about 2 months. Some days would be better than others, but not often. Eventually work decided they weren't going to approve my leave any longer and I was required to go back. This was hard but I knew that what I was doing wasn't healthy either. It took a good week or two but I finally caught the groove of things and was able to work with my anxiety. The physical symptoms got less and less prominent and I was starting to make some promising progress.

All of my coping mechanisms are failing, I can't get myself to go to sleep. Eventually when I do get to sleep I stay down for 12+ hours because if I get up I have to deal with all the other symptoms I experience because of this godforsaken anxiety. I'm having daily panic attacks and I'm at my limit. I can't live like this. I'm not even living at this point. I'm just struggling to survive every single day. It genuinely feels like I'm dying. 
I'm not suicidal, at least I don't think I am. It's just so unbearably hard to live right now. With everything I'm experiencing and the trama of it all is just insane. I just want some level of normal back in my life and it's hard to see the light on the other side. I'm trying my best and I know Eventually I'll get there. It's just so hard. 

I'm starting a new medication tonight. Desvenlafaxine, or pristiq depending who you ask. This is gonna replace my zoloft. I'm just really really hoping this breaks this loop I've been stuck in. I'm ready to get back to living. Not whatever this is... 

Thanks for listening, I'd love to hear advice or your story too. I get how hard it is. Truly ♡ 

Much love and good luck to anyone else out there struggling. ","So you are going through a more severe episode I went through in my late 20's and again in my early 30's.  GAD and health anxiety... The short version is that I worked in healthcare IT in hospitals for a long time. I had to be in and setup servers and other things for various educational boards where they spoke about some fairly horrific and rare things. And then having witnessed and have been part of some incidents that even medical staff had a hard time with.  

Anyways, know this... You're not alone in your feelings. It isn't unique to you... That isn't meant to be a slight.  But knowing what you are going through others have as well, many, many others.

I have overcome it and this is how:

Exercise. Lots of exercise and you have to force yourself to do it. 

Diet - limit sugar, caffeine, and fried heavy foods and especially get rid of sodas.

Speak to someone on a regular basis.

Play a sport for rec, it doesn't matter if you're a noob or not.  I play hockey, and the community of people helps a ton. 

I used to be on benzos from time to time, and Lexapro.  I still take Lexapro but it's more because getting off of it is terrible. But I'm down to a child's dose of 5mg.

The other thing that has helped, and this might sound stupid, but it's been enlightening for me:

Realize that anxiety is just an emotion to be viewed.  Just like laughter, anger, etc.  It's just an emotion... Become an observer of the emotion instead of a participant.  It takes some practice, but simply acknowledging it instead of spiraling out of control with why you have the emotion is a game changer. When you experience anxiety the mind will try and make connections that are not rational which makes it worse.  Just be present in it... Like sitting and waiting for a storm to pass... Eventually you'll have clear skies again."
It feels like I'm not gonna make it,"If that's alright I'd like to share my story

For Context, I am a 26 year old Male. 

I've suffered from GAD my whole life, fortunately for me it didn't start to become too prominent until a few years back when I was diagnosed with some unknown stomach related illness (it was anxiety). I couldn't keep down food, and if I did manage my stomach would be in so much pain. Of course this resulted in extreme malnourishment and i lost a very unhealthy amount of weight. Anxiety was on 10 all the time due to the uncertainty of what was going on and just how overall awful i felt. 
I was dealing with this for almost an entire year before we finally understood what was going on. Doc put me on Zoloft and wow did it change my life. I went through your typical 'hell week' of mixed emotions and side effects from starting the sertraline. Then I just kinda woke up one day with... nothing. No anxiety, No fear, no uncomfortable physical symptoms. Just here, vibing. 
I took that as a sign and ran as hard as I could with it. I took back my life after being slaved to my anxiety for almost a year straight of day in and day out suffering. I found a job in a field that I really enjoy. I picked up athletic hobbies, I gained back all that weight I lost, I even got to improve my relationship with my girlfriend. Who is a godsend for her patience in dealing with me and my mental health. In every aspect of my life I was able to improve. 
Sure I'd have the occasional hiccup. I'm aware that I'll never be 'cured' of anxiety. However this felt like the next best thing. Small bouts of anxiety would sprout here and there and if I needed support I knew how to get it and move on. 

This lasted about 2 years. 

I will warn you, this part gets dark. I will be talking about suicidal ideology and health anxiety. 

Middle of this year, I started to notice some irregularities with my mental health. Found myself to be slightly more stressed than I typically would allow myself to be. Shorter distances between my small anxiety bouts and overall just kinda felt like crap. 
I was laying down to go to bed and I was having a bit of anxiety but I didn't bother to worry about it because sleep almost always helps. Then I felt this god awful pain rush through my chest as if I was having a heart attack. I immediately went into fight or flight, all the alarms in my body were going off as if this was a life threatening situation. This induced what I would label as the worst panic attack I've experienced in my life. I was able to rationalize that the chances of this being a life threatening event was very slim however I continued to panic. Uncontrollable shaking, sobbing, hyperventilating, the works. I eventually exhausted myself to the point that I fell asleep. Woke up the next day and immediately I was anxious. More so than I'd ever normally experience. Along with this strange roaming sharp pain in my chest. Naturally, I panicked. This lead my brain to stop rationalizing and I was convinced I was dying. 
Decided to head to the urgent care to get some answers and hopefully some peace of mind. I told them first that I do have an anxiety and panic disorder however I'm having chest pains that I've never experienced before. They took me very seriously which I appreciate and ran an EKG. Everything looked normal except for one little blip, typically they wouldn't even bother to raise an eyebrow over it but they decided to be on the safe side and instructed me to head to the ER so they can run additional tests there. Lol Naturally, I had another panic attack. Calmed down enough to get to the ER where I spent close to 8 hours total. They ran EKGs, Blood Work, and X-rays. Everything came back totally normal with no worries. This gave me a little peace of mind but raised another question. 

What the fuck is wrong with me then? 

For the next week I continued to endure these physical symptoms. Constantly fighting my body's human instinct that 'somethings wrong'  and just overall very anxious. More so than I'd ever typically experience. It was debilitating, I couldn't function. Every basic task felt like a mountain to climb and would almost always lead to panic. I had to be totally stimulated by tv, reading, video games, something HAD to be distracting me just so I'd feel slightly better. 
It got bad enough that I couldn't work. Every waking second was hell for me. Luckily I had FMLA time at work so I took that and applied for short term leave. 
In the mean time I went back to my normal doctor and explained what was going on. He wanted to give me an 'oh shit' medication like Ativan or Xanax however I declined, I explained that im constantly struggling and sedating me 24/7 is no way to live. He agreed and decided to increase my Zoloft and prescribed me Buspirone to take daily and nightly to attempt to curb some of those more 'physical' feelings I've been experiencing. Along with Hydroxyzine as a more tame 'oh shit' medication. 
Starting the new medication was easy, no side effects or anything just takes time to build up in my system. However I was still struggling. Every day I was an anxious mess. I basically lived at my computer because it seemed to be the only thing keeping me from being in a constant spiral. I would stay at my desk from the moment I woke up until I would get so tired I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore and I'd go crawl into bed. My girlfriend thankfully would make sure I eat and occasionally force me to go get some sunlight by taking a small walk with the dog. 
I continued this routine for about 2 months. Some days would be better than others, but not often. Eventually work decided they weren't going to approve my leave any longer and I was required to go back. This was hard but I knew that what I was doing wasn't healthy either. It took a good week or two but I finally caught the groove of things and was able to work with my anxiety. The physical symptoms got less and less prominent and I was starting to make some promising progress. 

This leads me to today. Over the past three weeks it's worse than it's ever been. All the previous things i typically experience started back up and more. I've been having new physical symptoms like hotness in my chest, sharp pains over my entire body, palpitations, my heart is constantly beating out of my chest,  or at least it feels that way. My stomach is in shambles all the time and I feel like I have a frog in my throat the refuses to go away. The problem is that it's constant. Never ending. I'm so exhausted from fighting myself all the time. Having to constantly give myself affirmation that I'm okay and it's just anxiety. All of my coping mechanisms are failing, I can't get myself to go to sleep. Eventually when I do get to sleep I stay down for 12+ hours because if I get up I have to deal with all the other symptoms I experience because of this godforsaken anxiety.

I'm starting a new medication tonight. Desvenlafaxine, or pristiq depending who you ask. This is gonna replace my zoloft. I'm just really really hoping this breaks this loop I've been stuck in. I'm ready to get back to living. Not whatever this is... 

Thanks for listening, I'd love to hear advice or your story too. I get how hard it is. Truly ♡ 

Much love and good luck to anyone else out there struggling. ","Amen to that brother

Whenever I’m sad I just put on some good ol’ Bon Jovi or any kind of rock music and drown my sorrows away with the vibes haha"

This leads me to today. Over the past three weeks it's worse than it's ever been. All the previous things i typically experience started back up and more. I've been having new physical symptoms like hotness in my chest, sharp pains over my entire body, palpitations, my heart is constantly beating out of my chest,  or at least it feels that way. My stomach is in shambles all the time and I feel like I have a frog in my throat the refuses to go away. The problem is that it's constant. Never ending. I'm so exhausted from fighting myself all the time. Having to constantly give myself affirmation that I'm okay and it's just anxiety. All of my coping mechanisms are failing, I can't get myself to go to sleep. Eventually when I do get to sleep I stay down for 12+ hours because if I get up I have to deal with all the other symptoms I experience because of this godforsaken anxiety. I'm having daily panic attacks and I'm at my limit. I can't live like this. I'm not even living at this point. I'm just struggling to survive every single day. It genuinely feels like I'm dying. 
I'm not suicidal, at least I don't think I am. It's just so unbearably hard to live right now. With everything I'm experiencing and the trama of it all is just insane. I just want some level of normal back in my life and it's hard to see the light on the other side. I'm trying my best and I know Eventually I'll get there. It's just so hard. 

I'm starting a new medication tonight. Desvenlafaxine, or pristiq depending who you ask. This is gonna replace my zoloft. I'm just really really hoping this breaks this loop I've been stuck in. I'm ready to get back to living. Not whatever this is... 

Thanks for listening, I'd love to hear advice or your story too. I get how hard it is. Truly ♡ 

Much love and good luck to anyone else out there struggling. ","I have a medical cannabis card, typically smoking is a relief for me and good for pain management. (Broke my back a while ago) but I do notice when things get rough for me like it is now that it has more cons than pros. I back off and don't smoke when I'm like this to prevent making things worse."
It feels like I'm not gonna make it,"If that's alright I'd like to share my story

For Context, I am a 26 year old Male. 

I've suffered from GAD my whole life, fortunately for me it didn't start to become too prominent until a few years back when I was diagnosed with some unknown stomach related illness (it was anxiety). I couldn't keep down food, and if I did manage my stomach would be in so much pain. Of course this resulted in extreme malnourishment and i lost a very unhealthy amount of weight. Anxiety was on 10 all the time due to the uncertainty of what was going on and just how overall awful i felt. 
I was dealing with this for almost an entire year before we finally understood what was going on. Doc put me on Zoloft and wow did it change my life. I went through your typical 'hell week' of mixed emotions and side effects from starting the sertraline. Then I just kinda woke up one day with... nothing. No anxiety, No fear, no uncomfortable physical symptoms. Just here, vibing. 
I took that as a sign and ran as hard as I could with it. I took back my life after being slaved to my anxiety for almost a year straight of day in and day out suffering. I found a job in a field that I really enjoy. I picked up athletic hobbies, I gained back all that weight I lost, I even got to improve my relationship with my girlfriend. Who is a godsend for her patience in dealing with me and my mental health. In every aspect of my life I was able to improve. 
Sure I'd have the occasional hiccup. I'm aware that I'll never be 'cured' of anxiety. However this felt like the next best thing. Small bouts of anxiety would sprout here and there and if I needed support I knew how to get it and move on. 

This lasted about 2 years. 

I will warn you, this part gets dark. I will be talking about suicidal ideology and health anxiety. 

Middle of this year, I started to notice some irregularities with my mental health. Found myself to be slightly more stressed than I typically would allow myself to be. Shorter distances between my small anxiety bouts and overall just kinda felt like crap. 
I was laying down to go to bed and I was having a bit of anxiety but I didn't bother to worry about it because sleep almost always helps. Then I felt this god awful pain rush through my chest as if I was having a heart attack. I immediately went into fight or flight, all the alarms in my body were going off as if this was a life threatening situation. This induced what I would label as the worst panic attack I've experienced in my life. I was able to rationalize that the chances of this being a life threatening event was very slim however I continued to panic. Uncontrollable shaking, sobbing, hyperventilating, the works. I eventually exhausted myself to the point that I fell asleep. Woke up the next day and immediately I was anxious. More so than I'd ever normally experience. Along with this strange roaming sharp pain in my chest. Naturally, I panicked. This lead my brain to stop rationalizing and I was convinced I was dying. 
Decided to head to the urgent care to get some answers and hopefully some peace of mind. I told them first that I do have an anxiety and panic disorder however I'm having chest pains that I've never experienced before. They took me very seriously which I appreciate and ran an EKG. Everything looked normal except for one little blip, typically they wouldn't even bother to raise an eyebrow over it but they decided to be on the safe side and instructed me to head to the ER so they can run additional tests there. Lol Naturally, I had another panic attack. Calmed down enough to get to the ER where I spent close to 8 hours total. They ran EKGs, Blood Work, and X-rays. Everything came back totally normal with no worries. This gave me a little peace of mind but raised another question. 

What the fuck is wrong with me then? 

For the next week I continued to endure these physical symptoms. Constantly fighting my body's human instinct that 'somethings wrong'  and just overall very anxious. More so than I'd ever typically experience. It was debilitating, I couldn't function. Every basic task felt like a mountain to climb and would almost always lead to panic. I had to be totally stimulated by tv, reading, video games, something HAD to be distracting me just so I'd feel slightly better. 
It got bad enough that I couldn't work. Every waking second was hell for me. Luckily I had FMLA time at work so I took that and applied for short term leave. 
In the mean time I went back to my normal doctor and explained what was going on. He wanted to give me an 'oh shit' medication like Ativan or Xanax however I declined, I explained that im constantly struggling and sedating me 24/7 is no way to live. He agreed and decided to increase my Zoloft and prescribed me Buspirone to take daily and nightly to attempt to curb some of those more 'physical' feelings I've been experiencing. Along with Hydroxyzine as a more tame 'oh shit' medication. 
Starting the new medication was easy, no side effects or anything just takes time to build up in my system. However I was still struggling. Every day I was an anxious mess. I basically lived at my computer because it seemed to be the only thing keeping me from being in a constant spiral. I would stay at my desk from the moment I woke up until I would get so tired I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore and I'd go crawl into bed. My girlfriend thankfully would make sure I eat and occasionally force me to go get some sunlight by taking a small walk with the dog. 
I continued this routine for about 2 months. Some days would be better than others, but not often. Eventually work decided they weren't going to approve my leave any longer and I was required to go back. This was hard but I knew that what I was doing wasn't healthy either. It took a good week or two but I finally caught the groove of things and was able to work with my anxiety.

I just want some level of normal back in my life and it's hard to see the light on the other side. I'm trying my best and I know Eventually I'll get there. It's just so hard. 

I'm starting a new medication tonight. Desvenlafaxine, or pristiq depending who you ask. This is gonna replace my zoloft. I'm just really really hoping this breaks this loop I've been stuck in. I'm ready to get back to living. Not whatever this is... 

Thanks for listening, I'd love to hear advice or your story too. I get how hard it is. Truly ♡ 

Much love and good luck to anyone else out there struggling. ",It is going to change how you look at anxiety. It’s counterintuitive but you must trust the process. Can’t recommend the book strongly enough.
Alcohol and Anxiety,Does anyone else struggle with panic attacks when becoming sober? I don’t drink too often but as I am now the legal drinking age of my area I have been out a few times and every time I start to sober up is when my anxiety skyrockets. Like I’ll be having fun while drunk and stuff but when I start to sober up is when all the anxiety comes back and it’s hard not to go into a panic attack with how overwhelming it is. Does anyone else experience this?,Yes I think it's pretty common. I don't drink anymore because of that reason. I found it would take me a few days to recover from the anxiety that came from drinking alcohol and it just wasn't worth it to me.

Does anyone else experience this?,"That is perfectly normal. Alcohol is a depressant, and a very strong inhibitor of anxiety. Sobering up means You get a rush of everything you inhibited, stress hormones being chief among that, alongside with a drop of feel-good hormones, whose release is heightened while drinking. Together, it's a particularly  shit combination, often so much so that emotionally and mentally sick people like us with anxiety drop drinking altogether for the sake of avoiding the very low lows."
Advice with Propranolol,"Hello!

Having had a great deal of anxiety my whole life, only to be amplified by some recent health issues, I have been recently prescribed some Propranolol (40mg).

I feel like it works great physically (my heartrate is more stable, I'm less shaky, my stomach feels better), but the problem is the mental. It is like my mind is battling my body.

My mind is telling my body to get stressed but my body (under Propranolol) feels normal(ish), therefore I just feel weird mentally like something is not right. I don't know if it is something I just play it in my head or if this is something that other people feel as well.

I was wondering if people had any advice on how to bring the mental anxiety down as well ? Is this something temporary while I get used to taking Propranolol ?

Thank you for any advice!","yeah i got prescribed this and im afraid to take it. not panicking makes me wanna panic it’s actually oddly mentally painful and i feel like my body isn’t working. tbh your body is probably so used to reacting, you’ve trained your mind to have those threatening thoughts. all the anxiety meds will do is stop a panic, i don’t think the thoughts will stop"

Does cognitive behavioral therapy work? What happens during CBT?,Hi! I’ve recently been diagnosed with anxiety disorder which I guess stems from having emotionally unavailable caregivers. This has in turn led me to have feelings of insecurity and worthlessness. I want to get better though. I was given meds but I haven’t taken any of them yet for fear of dependency. Have you tried CBT? Did it help? ,"Therapy worked for me. Meds made me worse.  Try therapy for a while and let your therapist help with the decision on medication.

Therapy takes time and effort, but it's worth it in the end. Therapy allows you to resolve some or all of the anxiety instead of only masking some of the symptoms.


Here's a couple of tips to maximize success:

• Always ask your therapist for homework in between sessions, something for you to work on. While the therapist only has one or two hours per week for you, you have all week to work on yourself. You need to be invested in healing yourself. The homework might sound stupid to you. Well, do it anyways.

• Never, ever lie to your therapist. You will only waste your money, and waste both you and your therapist's time.

• Never, ever hold anything back from your therapist, even if it's the most embarrassing topics (masturbation, etc.). If during a session some thought comes to mind, you share it, you don't hold back. It's as bad as point #2.

• Sometimes, people think that the therapist will just talk them out of their anxiety. This is not the case at all. I've had therapists do a whole session where they say nothing, maybe only a question or two. Somehow, your brain will lead you both on a path towards the root cause.

• Some people complain that they get a bad therapist. OK - happens in every profession. Go and find another that's a better fit for you. However, remember that they are not there to be your best friend or to mother you. They are there to help you find the conflict and heal.

I hope you find your answers."

Did it help? ,"Yep, my turns through CBT was super useful.


Like most therapy, it'll probably start out talking about what's worrying you, what's going on in your life and what you're trying to do but can't. Then they should give you homework on things to try. Maybe keeping a diary, breathing, refeaming situations, small exposure to things that make you anxious, etc. etc. The idea is to retrain your brain.


It takes some time and effort, but can be really successful. Usually works even better alongside medication."

Just want to know if people are feeling the same thing?,When my anxiety gets really bad I almost can’t feel any other emotion and everything feels unreal. Not just me or things I’m doing but other people and my relationships with them. I just wanted to know if anybody else has a similar feeling or goes through the same thing,"derealization. completely normal, feels like a game or just not real. it’s a form of anxiety. i get it when im really happy"
Any advice?,"I got prescribed sertraline about a day or two ago. I haven't taken it yet because it's creating so much anxiety and overthinking. This happens with other medication also (aside from paracetamol). I'm so worried about getting side effects and worse stuff happening also. I already struggle with swallowing pills but its the thoughts and anxiety about taking it that is the biggest problem, as I can figure out other ways to get the pill down. Also I know that once it's in my system I'll just be on edge all day with worry. I'm not sure why this is so stressful 😭. 

And is it even okay to take sertraline once I've taken paracetamol? I've had some painful cramps so I had to take it (the dissolvable ones lol)","Hello, can you describe these thoughts? Any specific fears or worries?"

I start getting so anxious just at the throught of taking medication I can start to feel queasy and dizzy. I even want to cry just at the thought. Later on I can feel such guilt over not taking them a little embarrassed for feeling the way I do."

Sorry but it's not realistic to get side effects of this kind. It is true there's a chance of bad side effects, but not like the ones you described. 
One good thing is if you get bad side effects, you can just stop taking it and in that case it'll get better quickly. 
Also when deciding to take it, I recommend to not be trying to reassure yourself how it's fine, safe or anything like that, as that creates the need to do it again and again, leading to not actually taking it in the end. It's best to not try to tell yourself anything in that regard and just take it. But I understand even that way it's still hard. I don't know what else to do though."
“something is off” feeling,"Sometimes I get this vague sensation that something is wrong, and I don’t know how to explain it to other people. 

it doesn’t involve any sort of overthinking/worrying. it doesnt feel like nerves, like when something’s about to happen that you’re anxious about. generally there’s not many physical symptoms. it feels like the part in a horror movie before the jumpscare - like, when you walk around a place that sort of just feels creepy and uncanny, but nothing bad’s actually happening. sometimes it feels like my hair is on end. I’ll say that I’m ‘anxious’ but that feels insufficient? It’s so much more of a deep-down  background feeling, compared to just getting worried about something. 

The best description I have is this one tv show where the protagonist ended up in this broken alternate reality. things appeared fine, but she kept insisting that ‘something wasn’t right’ and ‘I’m not supposed to be here’ and ‘something needs fixing’ but she couldn’t remember what had gone wrong or how things were supposed to be.

I struggled with these emotions the most when i was having my worst depressive episodes. I would feel like there was something deeply wrong with the world, or else deeply wrong with me, but when I tried to express what it was I would come up blank. 

It’s not especially debilitating I guess, it doesn’t scare me away from doing things, since it’s so undirected. but it really bothers me and I never know how to address it. it makes me feel the most like i’m going insane.

does anyone else get this? is it part of anxiety? something else?",Is it like a sudden feeling of impending doom?

You are just going through a really rough time . Irrational thoughts and catastrophising  go hand in hand with anxiety . It doesn’t  mean you are those thoughts or you are going to act on them. they are just feelings and thoughts they aren’t who you are or what you do. We can’t control what pops in our head but we can what we do with those thoughts. Remind yourself it just an anxious thought. 

The fact you are so intently worried about that happening absolutely shows you wouldn’t . Have you got someone you can be with right now to help you regulate? 

Are you getting professional help with your anxiety? I second the deep breathing and muscle relaxation to try to calm your body and thoughts. Maybe a walk outside to try and get back to the present moment. 

Have you tried the 54321? It involves identifying 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. It helps shift your focus from anxiety-provoking thoughts to the present moment where you are safe."

I have a kind of specific way to calm myself down in situations like those, so not sure its calming for everyone
But what I do is repeat affirmations (which I think in generall is helpfull, you just have to find the affirmation that calms you, and repeat repeat repeat, your brain wont have any capacity to think about much else then)

And I like to remind myself that whatever you do, itll end, if it ends now or later or how, we dont know
But nobody knows
And thats okay, because nothing really matters
Ask yourself why does it matter so much for you? We all die in the end, we all make mistakes while alive, its so normal, and its doesnt matter at all
Even if it matters for a second, what is a second in this whole existence, its nothing
Itll pass, and you will be fine


I truly wish you the best, again, take some deep breaths, maybe my thinking is not for you, then please just ignore that, but I believe the first part could be helpfull, if you just find your own affirmations

You are okay


Ohh wait just one more thing/ affirmation that actually also helps me tremendously is the thought:
""You are okay, you are not in immediate danger, (e.g. i have super fear of flying so I will just be gratefull Im not on a plaine atm, or giving a presentation, or whatever your worst fear is), so therefore you are okay, it could be worse, you are fine, you are not in immediate danger, you are okay""


Just as a disclaimer tho Im not a therapist or anything like that at all, its just what I figured out on my journey, so the rips are only from me, no therapist gave them to me
Im just afraid of hurting someone I guess
So in case I said something harmfull anybody please correct me
Just had that thought because realized maybe its not the beast idea to put your worst fear as a ""its okay bc ur not there"" thought, because I guess some peoples worst fear might not be so easily avoided as for me with flying
Althought now thinking about it more its actually not even my worst fear so yeah I think I stand by it
But Ild recommennd picking a fear that is avoidable, liek for me flying, seomething you can feel control over
For me it works, I really do hope it does for you as well ❤️

One more thing that got in my mind haha but comedy shows (or stand up) always help me, which ofc is not always an option, but if your at home and got nothing else to do, its my go to to take my mind off of things
Also fast asmr with lots of talking (podcasts probably work the same)
Theres also binaural beats for anxiety, I truly beleive in them (because they work for me) but its not ""proven"" I guess, just an idea, if your open to try it

I feel like I already said it like 3 tines now but yes I wish u the best ❤️"

I overcame that with therapy many years ago so believe me you can get through this and it won’t always be like this!

Literally can’t stand up straight in 1 spot without feeling like I’m wobbly or gonna collapse. Losing my fucking mind,". Dr has no ideas, been this way for MONTHS. Sinking feelings in my legs and back, always tense in the head and pressure. Neck pain bad, back of the head pain, shoulder pain, back tension, fatigue, arm weakness and aches. Jaw popping. Weird falling or dropping feelings no matter if I’m standing, sitting or lying down. Got a brain MRI and they didn’t see anything. Did a heart ultrasound, nothing. Have weird blood work involving my immune system but nothing else out of ordinary. This came OVER NIGHT and hasn’t left IN FUCKING MONTHS. And I have HAD IT. Dr just wants to send me to get my jaw looked at and then a psychiatrist and then a neurologist but I feel like there’s something majorly wrong with my neck or back.

I've had this going on for years, but I've gotten MUCH better than I used to be. Panic attacks and vertigo would feed off of each other.

Positive Zoloft experiences please (general and health anxiety),"After 3 years of speaking to my doctor about medication but being too nervous & trying to solve this on my own I finally started Zoloft 3 days ago. I could really use some positive stories of success. I’m trying to avoid the scary stories but it’s hard. 

I’m on it for generalized anxiety as well is pretty bad health anxiety. I’m starting on 25 mg for 6 days then 50 mg for 7 days and then 100 mg from there on out. I know it can be tricky to get through the beginning until it helps… so far I’m doing okay. I just feel really tired constantly and nauseous here and there. My anxiety might be a little worse but that could also be that I’m just triggered by knowing I’m taking this med now. ","Congratulations on taking the leap! I've been on Zoloft for GAD for over a year (in fact, I just picked up my prescription refill a few hours ago). The first week was pretty awful. The second was better but still rough. By around the fourth week, I started to notice a real difference in my day-to-day mood. It didn't magically make all my anxiety go away, but it felt like I had more...space in my brain, I guess? Because I wasn't using up all my mental energy just to get through the day without being overwhelmed.


YMMV, especially since you're increasing your dose fairly quickly. You could also consider asking your doctor if you could stay on one dose long enough to stabilize and work through the side effects before deciding whether that dosage works for you or whether you want to increase it. But follow your doctor's advice, not the advice of a random non-medical professional on Reddit ;) I will add, though, that if Zoloft doesn't work out for you, don't be discouraged. It just means you're one step closer to finding something else that will work better!


Finally, while Zoloft and other similar meds can be a big help, they're not a magic pill or a cure-all. They work best when combined with other lifestyle changes like healthy diet and exercise, good sleep habits, and learning good coping mechanisms to deal with anxiety and any other difficulties in your life. If you haven't discussed any of that with your doctor, I highly recommend it. I wish you luck and hope it all works out for you!"
"Head tingling, facial tightness, headaches, nausea, vertigo etc.","I have this weird tingling that happens on my head, generally on my left side, front and back, or just naturally over my head. I also get headaches mostly felt on my left side. I also get this weird facial tightness, where my muscles don’t feel entirely relaxed. It can be so hard to describe these sensations and I feel crazy at times for trying. Been experiencing bouts of nausea and vertigo amongst this all too. I did get a CT scan and it came back clear and my doctor told me to monitor my symptoms for 2-3 months, but of course I worry for the worst. Has anyone else experienced these symptoms and can give some advice or comment on their own journeys? ","I ask, how is Your posture? Do You work with computers a lot? Are Your hands in front of You a lot? Do You regularly stretch Your neck, shoulders and upper back? Also, how is Your anxiety lately? Flaring more than usual? Extreme levels? Or prolonged anxiety lately?

I had gone through basically the identical spell. However, anxiety is really the only acceptable answer, and this can be two-fold. First, it can either be caused directly due to sheer stress. Second, it can be a condition caused by anxiety such as poor posture and muscle tightness in the neck, traps and shoulders. The symptoms are too mild and varied to be a serious physical condition, and they are hallmarks of anxiety or anxiety-adjacent physical conditions given their presentation. I would say the vertigo was the worst part of it all for me, in that it was the only one that actually affected me in any meaningful way. However, all symptoms have since subsided, dizziness lasting the longest. It varied in intensity, but that is alright. If I had been truly sick with something, I'd legitimately be falling the fuck over, and puking.

I did find that stretching my neck muscles and traps helped, You should try the same. Stretch the front of Your neck, back, sides (which is basically an upper trap stretch). Posture work is required, also.

Note however that it is very possible that none of the above is the correct answer and it is very possible that it may just be too much stress, which You can quite literally only wait out, easing the process with mood-lifting activities with which You are probably very acquainted with. I cannot overstate the importance of these physical, social and mental activities. Do engage in them as much as possible in life."

Where it would actually be so bad i couldnt sleep. I called them growing pains. WHAT IS IT. 😭,No. The pain is kind of similar to a constant bad cramp

I think I might have late stage cancer,Hi everyone my name is Jason and I’m 25. Since last  year in November I was experiencing blood on stool and had stool tests done that showed high inflammation in calprotectin which normal is 0-120 mine was high at 7000. I had a colonoscopy done and it was all normal. I was feeling burning and minimal pain but that went away in the months. But about a month ago i noticed I was passing blood without stool. I then have been having diarrhea mixed with blood. Then I noticed blood was mixed in stool. With that I came to realize I might have late stage cancer with the blood also being darker red times but mostly it’s bright red. I haven’t had major weight loss or never throw up. But doing research and seeing what people say it doesn’t look good. I have a endoscopy in two weeks and I’m preparing for the news. My GI doctor wasn’t concerned with cancer when I mentioned my symptoms but for me I feel strong it’s gonna be bad. I just wanted insight to see if there was any chance this isn’t cancer. My mental state has been terrible and I can’t function normally anymore. I literally feel like I’m gonna find out I will die soon and to be ready. It’s worrisome seeing just passing blood and nothing else and willing to see bright or dark red. I seen it was 0.0001 chance of cancer my age but I feel like I guess ima end up that way. I have no appetite and only eat one meal a day with a bad diet. I just wanna live and I appreciate any help.,"Hopefully it's just a bleeding ulcer, my father had the same symptoms at your age, he's still here at 73 yrs old. God bless and good luck to you brother. Fight like hell whatever it is, your too young and stronger than you think."

Hemorrhoids. Could also be diverticulitis or dozens of other things if inflammation is taken into account.

Dunno why anxiety is doing to us, but it's quite normal to think of cancer and sudden death instead of simpler and more common diagnosis.

Expect to get your results and be disappointed by something mundane."

Given your age, your clear colonoscopy, and your current symptoms, I’m very comfortable saying this isn’t cancer. Blood that’s bright red in stool means that the bleed is close to the exit. I’d lean toward hemorrhoids. 

Of course, bring all this up with your doctor, but you can relax in that this is almost certainly NOT cancer, especially late stage. You’d have a host of concerning and noticeable symptoms (unexplained weight loss is most common, but also night sweats, lethargy, etc.) that you don’t talk about here.

Fear of cancer is extremely common. One thing I can tell you is that cancer care has come a long way in the last few decades. You can lessen your risk with a healthy lifestyle, getting vaccines, and keeping up with screenings."

It's weird and it's embarrassing and it's gonna be super scary, but chances are it's something inflammatory mixed with hemorrhoids. This is coming from someone with pretty severe health anxiety, but try not to worry about it too much.

Even if it was cancer (which I cannot stress enough how much it doesn't sound like that), there wouldn't be anything you can do about it till you've been checked. You're allowed to have good quality of life, try not to let it rule over you if you can until you have your appointment. Good luck man."

She needs a particular diet to keep it at bay, plus meds when she has en episode. It's bothersome, although usually it does show up during colonoscopies so idk. Chron's can also cause blood in the stool, but idk what other symptoms it gives - she is constantly at risk of developing it, so she needs a colonoscopy every two years or whenever she has a particularly bad flare-up. But things got considerably better since she's gotten a competent dietician.

If it's something like her flare-ups, you can try to do what my ma was advised to do one time and eat simple rice with boiled zucchini or carrots for the next 2-3 days, plus drinking laurel leaf tea a few times a day (3-6 leaves depending on the size, inside a mug, with boiled water, seeped for 20m; It doesn't taste much but it lowers intestine inflammation).

I think I might have late stage cancer,Hi everyone my name is Jason and I’m 25. Since last  year in November I was experiencing blood on stool and had stool tests done that showed high inflammation in calprotectin which normal is 0-120 mine was high at 7000. I had a colonoscopy done and it was all normal. I was feeling burning and minimal pain but that went away in the months. But about a month ago i noticed I was passing blood without stool. I then have been having diarrhea mixed with blood. Then I noticed blood was mixed in stool. With that I came to realize I might have late stage cancer with the blood also being darker red times but mostly it’s bright red. I haven’t had major weight loss or never throw up. But doing research and seeing what people say it doesn’t look good. I have a endoscopy in two weeks and I’m preparing for the news.

That doesn't necessarily mean anything as several IBDs can only be detected when you are having a flair up. If you weren't having a flair up during the colonoscopy then it can be missed.

The endoscope is to check the upper GI tract to identify other types of bleeding or ulcers. Ulcers further up in the GI tract usually present as black and tarry, not bright red in your stool though some nasty ulcers may still result in bright red blood. 

You should be pressing your GI doctor for a diagnosis. A year of bloody stools is not something that should be ignored.  That's something that they should have a clear diagnosis of by now."

Yes they can. They would have been found upon visual inspection of OP's anus or during the initial colonoscopy. Also, hemorrhoids are unlikely to bleed significantly. Usually just a few drops on TP for most people. OP would have a diagnosis by now if it were hemorrhoids.

Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) isn't the same as IBD. IBDs are caused by inflammation within the GI tract."

Its just that I probably got tired of being constantly anxious and now Im depressed. There is nothing that bad happening in my life right now but it just doesnt give same beautiful chills it used to.

It literally fixed my brain for a couple years but I havent done it for so long because I moved to a state where its illegal. They saved me from the stupid anxiety spirals. But yk what else helps me is doing things that scare me until i feel absolutely nothing about it. If your anxiety gets too bad you could always start a temporary strict life style to fix it. Take vitamins and other supplements, workout everyday hardcore, drink the exact amount of water that you're supposed to have, completely cut out junk food. Drink protein shakes and take iron. And i guarantee if you do that for two weeks straight it'll screw your head back on a little bit. You need to do something that'll snap you out of the cycle you're stuck in right now."

I just feel like life lost its beauty somehow, and why im here is because I've dealt with anxiety and I want to know if this emptiness is caused by long term anxiety that is gone now.

Otherwise I often feel like I need to push myself too hard and give myself some high motivation because I feel so uninterested. Im currently studying economics I have zero interest in, its so hard and boring its pain to look at my results which are so low, all that in city I never liked.. This sounds more like depressive problem but im so confused because everything is so meesed up and I cant tell how I am feeling, like alexithymia

Thank you for advice :)"

It is supposed to knock you back into feeling grounded because for a moment your senses are too “wait wtf” to be anxious. It’s like a quick reset to put your mind back on earth.

heart racing/anxiety ,"I have no idea why, but lately (mainly at night) I will randomly get knots in my stomach, heart palpitations, heavy breathing, and a sense of dread and anxiety. I have no idea.

Anyone else have this?","It seems like people dealing with anxiety tend to feel it spike either in the morning or evening most heavily. No idea what makes the difference or why. The mornings are bad for me. 

But evenings used to be really hard for me. What helped me a little was taking magnesium a couple hours before I wanted to sleep, paired with tea which I would add ashwagandha and valerian root to. The combination of magnesium, valerian root, and ashwagandha usually helps me to feel much more calm by the time I’m wanting to go to sleep."

Are anxiety symptoms the same or do they change?,Is there set symptoms or does it vary?,"As others have said, anxiety shows up differently for everyone. Sometimes you get used to the regular  anxiety symptoms you have and then (as if just to make you worry), new anxiety symptoms take over. It can be unnerving. 

Anxiety stores in your body especially if you suppress your emotions, so the more you ignore your emotions, the worse your symptoms can get. ISTDP (Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy) can help a lot with this."

How to deal with panic attacks in public,"i’ve been getting panic attacks in public recently. a sense of dread washes over me completely, i get very light headed and feel like i’ll pass out, and my breathing is shallow. during these i just try to deep breathe but they’re really difficult to deal with and i’m scared of going in public now. ",No one has ever died of panic attacks. It’s you body’s defense mechanism which protects you from danger but the probelm it’s acting in the wrong time that’s all. Learn how to lean into it and embracing it instead of fighting it no matter how freaky it gets. This is the real and absolut way to overcome panic attacks
Feel like I’m stuck in an endless loop,"I (22f) am so so so sick of having anxiety. I am at a point where my anxiety is so bad that it’s starting to cause physical symptoms like dizziness, nausea, chest pains and shortness of breath. I feel like I’m slowly dying. 

But ironically, I also am so anxious about my health and tend to convince myself that I have things wrong with me when i probably don’t (i.e migraine = brain tumour/cancer or anxiety poops = bowel/colon cancer). It’s getting to a point where I’m starting to wonder whether I am experiencing the dizziness, nausea, chest pains and shortness of breath because of my anxiety or if it’s because of a serious underlying health condition. I know the smart thing to do would go to the doctor and get tests done but because of past traumatic experiences I am petrified to get medical exams due to pain and fear of needles and anaesthesia.

It just feels like an endless cycle with no hope and I’m feeling so down and defeated lately. Hopefully, things will get better soon.","Not sure how much help I'll be, but as someone who has GAD that is not centered on health related issues at all, I have most of the same symptoms you do, so it is unlikely you have an underlying physical health condition since that would mean I and many other people on this forum would have similar physical health problems. I have nausea, dizziness and rapid heart beat along with insomnia and sweating. I've had shortness of breath in the past as well and they are all tied to mental health. I'm middle age and have had a ton of tests done for...all the exciting things that come with the territory of being middle aged and aside from high triglycerides, I'm in decent shape. So all of my symptoms are from GAD and yours likely are too.

Maybe don't focus on seeing a doctor that is going to run tests and do things that make you uncomfortable and instead see a psychiatrist who can prescribe meds that will help with the anxiety. They'll ask you to fill out some forms and questionnaires about symptoms and that is it. And you can do telehealth appointments so you don't even have to go to their office. If you start treatment and see these physical symptoms fade and it may be that with lowered anxiety you'll also lose some of your fear about seeing a doctor in the future, should the need arise."

I have recently started therapy to work through the roots of my anxiety and I fear that talking about the things that make me anxious has the effect of bringing them to the forefront of my mind which is making me think more about them than I did before. 

I will look into the idea of anti-anxiety medication with a psychologist. My only fear is that any of the people that I know who tried anti-anxiety medication said that it either made them feel numb or it made them feel like a zombie. I don’t seem to know anyone irl who has had a positive experience with medication which I think has caused me to avoid it for so long but I will definitely consider it. 

Again, thank you for your comment"

I've struggled with finding a decent med for years and it is a trade off with side effects for me as well, at least so far. There is a genetic test, Genesight, a mouth swab DNA test that can ID which meds might work best and cause fewer side effects based on your genetic profile. Not sure if you want to get into all that or not. There are also non-SSRI medications like propranolol that can help with the physical manifestations of anxiety, but, like with everything else, some people have side effects. I can take it no problem, my partner got depressed on it. Buspirone is another one that typically has lowered side effects relative to many other medications. 

Lots of trial and error with meds unfortunately. Anyway, you're welcome and good luck."

is everything going to be okay .? ,"hi all, currently up late having a really bad anxious episode (i don’t know exactly what to call it but that’s the closest definition to describe how i feel). I just really don’t know what i’m doing anymore, me and my mom don’t really understand each other so things are extra difficult and i guess im scared in a way?

for context, i’m a junior in hs, taking 3 ap classes this year after dropping my only one last year, I also ride horses competitively and own my own young horse. So days are busy as you can imagine, I leave the house at 7:45 AM and don’t return till about 8 PM, until 11 when i go to bed i do homework.
I have diagnosed anxiety and depression, and have been recommended medication by two different therapists and my own doctor. My main issue is worried about is grades, as I have a deal with my mom that if she pays for my equestrian endeavors, I pay for my own college (by use of scholarships and whatnot). but she also makes (or tried to make) me get straight A’s. I don’t think i’m going to make the quota this year. I have two b’s which is essentially a 3.75. I cannot convince my mom this is a good GPA and i feel like she will never be proud of me. Talking about it turns into an argument, I just don’t know what to do, I can’t be proud of myself for anything and I feel like a failure to my own parents even though I tried really hard, but she won’t ever see it or notice. I know most scholarships aren’t available until senior year but i’m so stressed about what if i can’t find any or anything like that. Finals coming up doesn’t make it any better, last year first semester finals i was so stressed sick i was dry heaving in the school lobby and at home, I couldn’t eat the entire day all because i had an algebra II final.
I just can’t stop thinking, about everything, not even school, just the future and anything life has up ahead. My brain won’t shut off, anything and everything I do i’m scared. Everything I used to find fun I can’t even think of doing because I feel unworthy of being able to do it and any “anxiety attack” tip i try just doesn’t work and it just spirals out of control until i go to sleep or start mindlessly doomscrolling on my phone to distract, it’s unfortunately obvious too and i feel like everyone around me knows i have anxiety, I pick at my skin, pull out my hair, lashes, brows, and constantly fidgeting. I feel like a fawn stuck in a bear trap 24/7.

I'm just getting out of a really bad and long period of anxiety myself. Starting medication has been a huge help.

Destructive habits are hard avoid when all the coping strategies we try don't seem to do anything. But those habits aren't really helping either, they just give us something else to worry about on top of everything else.

Do the best you can every day while taking care of yourself. If your family doesn't accept your best, that's on them. You have to learn to be okay with yourself regardless of what anyone else thinks of you, your perceived failures and accomplishments. 

If we are okay with ourselves, if we are better on the inside, we can do more out in the world too. Beating ourselves up for not meeting other people's expectations keeps us stuck."

I just really don’t know what i’m doing anymore, me and my mom don’t really understand each other so things are extra difficult and i guess im scared in a way?

for context, i’m a junior in hs, taking 3 ap classes this year after dropping my only one last year, I also ride horses competitively and own my own young horse. So days are busy as you can imagine, I leave the house at 7:45 AM and don’t return till about 8 PM, until 11 when i go to bed i do homework.
I have diagnosed anxiety and depression, and have been recommended medication by two different therapists and my own doctor. My main issue is worried about is grades, as I have a deal with my mom that if she pays for my equestrian endeavors, I pay for my own college (by use of scholarships and whatnot). but she also makes (or tried to make) me get straight A’s. I don’t think i’m going to make the quota this year. I have two b’s which is essentially a 3.75. I cannot convince my mom this is a good GPA and i feel like she will never be proud of me. Talking about it turns into an argument, I just don’t know what to do, I can’t be proud of myself for anything and I feel like a failure to my own parents even though I tried really hard, but she won’t ever see it or notice. I know most scholarships aren’t available until senior year but i’m so stressed about what if i can’t find any or anything like that. Finals coming up doesn’t make it any better, last year first semester finals i was so stressed sick i was dry heaving in the school lobby and at home, I couldn’t eat the entire day all because i had an algebra II final.
I just can’t stop thinking, about everything, not even school, just the future and anything life has up ahead. My brain won’t shut off, anything and everything I do i’m scared. Everything I used to find fun I can’t even think of doing because I feel unworthy of being able to do it and any “anxiety attack” tip i try just doesn’t work and it just spirals out of control until i go to sleep or start mindlessly doomscrolling on my phone to distract, it’s unfortunately obvious too and i feel like everyone around me knows i have anxiety, I pick at my skin, pull out my hair, lashes, brows, and constantly fidgeting. I feel like a fawn stuck in a bear trap 24/7.

TL;DR I am up all night, sobbing, literally, over a 3.75 GPA and how my mother will view me.","Thank you, luckily i am talking to my schools therapist!"

","3 years ago I was in a bad spot...

I was vaping nicotine and having 1-2 drinks everyone night to relax ..

Then I started getting really anxious.. about a 7-8/10. My stomach got messed up and I lost a lot of weight and started meds ( remeron ) 

I stopped vaping and drinking.. and within a few weeks I started feeling better.. I did some reading/research about vaping and anxiety and how it messes up your gut.. so I started eating healthy and taking a lot of probiotic rich foods and I was feeling so good I tapered off of the remeron ( fast taper it sucked... But I was off it in 3 weeks ) 

Currently I'm off of all meds and doing pretty well most days.. I have an emergency script for Klonopin.. where 15 doses will last me over a year.. and most importantly I'm back to sleeping well.."

","I don't have a story of ""getting rid of the anxiety diagnosis."" Instead, my experience has been more about learning how to cope with the anxiety so that it doesn't control my life. That might sound counterintuitive, but a big insight for me has been recognizing how much anxiety in my life has been caused by judging my emotions or reactions. Feeling like I ""should"" or ""shouldn't"" feel a certain way - for example, I ""shouldn't"" feel anxious and thus anxiety becomes something I need to get rid of by any means possible - actually backfires and makes me more anxious. My ""success story,"" instead, has been about learning to be aware of my emotions and accept them without judging them - yes, even the ""bad"" or unpleasant ones. When I don't feel threatened by my anxiety, it becomes much easier to manage. Even if I'm never totally ""cured"" of anxiety, I can learn to live with it because I realize that as much as it sucks to be in the throes of it, it's not going to hurt me. 


How to get to that point? For me, it's been a matter of therapy and learning mindfulness exercises. And it definitely hasn't happened overnight. Baby steps.


I don't know if any of this is helpful when you're in the middle of a really rough patch, but take heart! There are ways out of this dark place you're in right now. It may take some time to find what's right for you, and you might still have some level of anxiety or it may pop up here and there in the future. But you can and you will make it through this!"

","Not fully recovered at this point. I first started experiencing anxiety about four months ago after I had a pretty bad panic attack one night. At first it felt all-consuming. It was all I could think about every day. All my time was spent trying to just get through the day. But with time and care it’s been slowly getting better. It’s been non-linear. If I try and look just day by day it’s hard to see the progress. One day will feel horrible, the next decent, then pretty bad again. But when I look week over week and month over month I can see the improvement. At first I just would notice once in a while a few hours of a few days started to feel somewhat normal. Then more hours of more days. Eventually I had a short work trip where I had a couple days where I didn’t notice anxiety hardly at all. Then it came back again when I returned, but not as bad as before. 

All to say, with time and care it does feel like improvement and “regular life” is attainable. 

Mostly I’ve just been working hard on a few key things:

- work to understand the anxiety. Through therapy - try to appreciate what the anxiety is trying to do for me. Not to be as resistant to it. 

- work to move past the anxiety. Not to give it the loudest voice at the table. To take a more proactive approach to the day instead of a simply reactive role where the anxiety dictates the day. 

- I cut out caffeine and alcohol, and started drinking way more water and tea. I include some simple supplements in my tea, like valerian root and ashwagandha, to help manage my cortisol and calm my nervous system. 

- I also started taking magnesium 

- I started prioritizing my sleep schedule. Not obsessive, but trying to be very intentional about going to sleep at a consistent time every night. For me, that’s between 10:00-11:00. That typically means I choose not to watch or play anything very intense after like 8:00 or 9:00, to help myself start winding down. I switch to playing or watching something more familiar instead.

I’m still very much on this journey. Anxiety still feels like a major part of every day. But based on this trajectory I’m hopeful that with another few months of intentionality and care , maybe longer, maybe less, I might be able to feel normal more often than not. Only time will tell."

You can't get rid of anxiety, you can only learn to live with it and manage it (unless you take the path of medication). Personally though, I always had it growing up and at some point I thought I'd overcome it and U actually felt free but a certain event happened where I pushed myself too far and I basically went back to my room unable to drive away even 10 minutes from home. I can push it but it's hard. Slowly over the past year I've been slowly extending myself back out, little by little I've been going a little further for my walk or purposefully making myself anxious and exposing myself to it, then learning to manage it and it's been going well I think.. I can't say it's a success story but because of the whole ordeal a lot of good has come from it. I've become closer with my partner more than ever and I've learnt heaps about myself and for that I'm thankful so in some ways you could say it was a success but ongoing."

","Around a year after moving out from my parent's, in 2017 ish, I was in a safer space to begin processing their negative impact on my emotions and self-esteem. This lead to me spiraling into anxiety/OCD (never got diagnosed, but very sure I would have been if I had gone to therapy). I was switching between anxious and numb, but mostly numb. Was questioning all my thoughts,  feelings, etc. It went up and down for two years, I don't remember how I felt really, mostly numb and anxious I guess. But I probably had some better and worse times as well. I then met my now boyfriend, and started battling really bad relationship OCD (again, not officially diagnosed). I was so anxious about the relationship and about getting that close to someone. This led to anxiety on other areas in life as well, I was generally very stressed. But I started slowly working on my self-esteem, thought patterns, and processing my bad experiences and feelings. This was a very slow process, and I often felt like I was not making any progress at all. It went a lot up and down on the way - always remember that healing is NOT a linear process! I thought I would always feel like that. But it turns out, I did make progress, because I'm in a so much better place today. I think I would say I was ""healed"" maybe around a year ago. This does not mean I started being always happy and never anxious and everything's good. For me, ""healed"" means that the OCD/anxiety is very rarely triggered, and if it is, it doesn't become as powerful, and I know better how to handle it. So it is no longer an area of focus in life. It also means I am rarely numb, I'm feeling a lot more of my feelings. Life is still going up and down, but in a more healthy way. I'm way more happy, and I managed to allow myself to become very close to my boyfriend and letting myself loving him. Healing also means accepting that I have a bit of emotional baggage, and I become stressed and tired more easily than my boyfriend for example, so I have to be more aware of when I need to slow down and take care of myself. But I also know this will also improve. It's gonna be a life long project to work on all of this, but now I'm in a good place AND can still continue to heal so I become more and more robust😊"

","This is a big step - acceptance, and living with it. It might stop there, but I think for many, you can progress further if you continue to accept your feelings. I think I was at the ""acceptance stage"" for a long time, but I feel like I have progressed now, towards somewhat more balanced feelings and more happy.

Hair twisting bad?,"Hi all, I have anxiety that causes me to twist my hair and my mother thinks that it is going to make my hair fall out. I get annoyed whenever she tells me this and recently my aunt overheard and thought it would be funny to make a comment about (which she does a lot) it then I quietly exploded (not at anyone, just stood up and left the room)

Is it really that bad? If so, any tips for dealing with it?","I'm an anxious hair twister too. It doesn't give me hair loss at the scalp, but it does fray the ends. The hair on either side of my face is a few inches shorter than the rest. That said, I'm the only one who notices it.

I got a fidget ring and bracelet and try to play with them instead when I catch myself twisting my hair.

Tell your family that nobody ever made positive changes as a result of being shamed!"
Whats Happening to me??,"I have been fine all day - no major anxiety symptom and had a laugh and been good - went to bed and was fine and decided to put a podcast on and fall asleep and 20mins later I'm feeling heavy, tingly, fuzzy feeling..i don't know how to explain it

Is this anxiety?? ","Im sorry you’re having to deal with that. I have a long history with anxiety and stress, and weird bodily stuff related to it. I experience something very similar during periods of time when I’ve been under heavy stress sometimes. Or if I’ve been sleep deprived for a long time. Or both. I’m going through a bout of it right now. For me it kind of ramps up, and then goes away when I either calm down or get my sleep schedule back in order. 

I’ll wake up after falling asleep naturally, and I get this weird feeling. A lot of times it’s about 20 or 30 minutes after I fall asleep. It’s almost like I’m just aware that I’m awake all of a sudden. I usually know when it’s going to happen then, if it’s going to. I get kind of a buzzing or vibrating sensation, like an internal vibration. Sometimes in my core, sometimes extending to my limbs. Sometimes my vision kind of flickers in sync with it. I feel like that for a few tens of seconds to a couple of minutes (tapering off when it’s longer) until I kind of fully come to. It can have lesser or greater intensity. 

My understanding, in my case, is that it’s a sleep issue/anxiety and stress related thing. It’s like my body is in a hyper-vigilant state and something causes me to wake suddenly, and it’s like ready to go before I’m ready to go. I had a major issue with it during some deep anxiety stuff and sleep deprivation in college, and I had an EEG study done. Didn’t find anything. My doctors then, and now, have confirmed to me that what I described is not uncommon, especially for people with major stress and anxiety, and I have generalized anxiety disorder. 

FWIW when I just recently checked in other my doctor about the current bout of it, she was totally unconcerned about it as a problem in and of itself, beyond being a symptom of stress and anxiety, and just wanting to make sure I’m getting enough sleep. 

I’ve done some causal reading into it and it sounds like it could be sort of like the sensory filtering functions that you have when you’re awake haven’t come online yet, I think they call it sensory gating, and so this raw input signal gets interpreted as buzzing or other weirdness until all your systems come online. As a guy coming from information tech, it’s like I woke up during the system POST test. I’ve also read that it’s been hypothesized that your body may interpret the disconnect that happens from waking information from sensory systems and other bodily systems when you transition sleep states could be what triggers the sudden awakening because of the hyper-vigilance. Almost like it’s a fall. I asked my doctor about this stuff, and she said that’s what’s she’s heard about it as well.

I wouldn’t want to suggest anybody shouldn’t check in with their doctor if they’re wanting to check on it, but for right now/what its worth, I would guess if you have history with anxiety and stress, it’s probably like mine and other people’s I’ve read about it. There’s definitely multiple posts about this type of issue on this subreddit."

","I am 47 years old and I have literally, in all my life, never heard of a woman who gave a damn about whether someone was on SSRIs. I guess the question is, do you want a woman, or anyone really, in your life who would belittle you for taking a medication you need to be well? I don't know what you're reading or hearing, but it sounds toxic and it is certainly not representative of society as a whole. 

No one even needs to know you're on an SSRI either. It is no one's business what medications you take but yours. 

And the idea that people that are on them are somehow weaker than others...what difference does it make? I mean, people drink, smoke, dip and do all kinds of drugs to cope with life and reality. You go on an SSRI and you're somehow weaker than a guy that is knocking back a 6 pack after work? An SSRI means you'll have a functioning liver in 30 years.

I'll tell you a little about my father. He was, physically, one of the strongest men I ever knew. Worked as a lineman, smoked, drank, dipped and drank some more. Inhumanly strong. Mentally, he suffered from anxiety and OCD, and this was before there were meds that could treat him. He was miserable and he made me and my mom miserable and there was not enough alcohol and tobacco out there to treat his ailments. He died at 46 from a cancer that was almost certainly tied to his lifestyle habits. If he had access to an SSRI in the 1970s, he might still be here."

anyone else relate? ,"so i have really bad anxiety where i am 100% convinced i have something serious. last year it was a stroke, i spent weeks in the hospital because my face was going numb. i’m (21) female. year before that it was lymphoma. now for the last year it’s been schizophrenia. i’ve seen things out of the corner of my eyes, i go through phases where it’s bad for a few weeks, then i don’t think about it for a month, then it comes back etc. i’m very paranoid about developing this. i read a thing where someone said before they were diagnosed they were scared of becoming schizophrenic, so that defeated everything else i read about not realizing that it’s happening to you. i was hearing kinda a very low thumping noise last night and had to check for over an hour where it was coming from (i also have diagnosed ocd). i think it was coming from my ceiling fan, i finally got exhausted and went to sleep. i read a while back that schizophrenics hear thumping noises and loud music so that’s why i’m freaking out. in the middle of the night i was 60% asleep 40% awake and i was having a dream about something and i heard the man’s voice in my dream in real life.. like heard it. but i was dreaming about it… so that caused a panic attack. there’s so many other things i experience but i’m so sick of seeking reassurance from friends and family and i cant even sit down and watch a movie cause my brain is on paranoid mode. i am so scared of everything. i go through phases where it gets bad, and then i literally won’t think about it for a month and i’ll have no symptoms and i’ll feel fine. ",This is me 😭😭😭😭😭
How do I make professionals take my anxiety seriously? ,"So my anxiety is so bad I can’t leave my house. 
I live in supported accommodation so I need to do communal laundry and take bins outside the building. To order groceries I need to walk to the building door which means I’ll likely see people walking around or have the people at the office talk to me. There’s a communal kitchen which I cannot use so I’m limited to an air fryer where I live, microwave and toaster. Which isn’t bad but I can’t properly cook certain foods.

I have more mild symptoms than what you shared here, and my psychiatrist, therapist, and even gynecologist (my anxiety and panic disorders are linked to my cycle, I have PMDD) were able to diagnose me and properly treat me, with little no fight needed on my part.

Are you holding back details because when sharing with the professionals you are engaging with? I know shame and guilt can come up for me when sharing, I found in the beginning if I write down situations and symptoms and present it to the professionals I'm seeing, it's a little easier. 

It does sound like you have somewhat of a diagnosis, I also found that I sometimes need to go back to the original person that provided me treatment and tell them what they originally diagnosed doesn't feel right."

I don’t know the exact reason but they kind of brushed it off when I asked.

I’ve heard of radical acceptance but I struggle to understand how it would work. 

In my eyes, if you hate something you do; you want to change it and therefore work toward it. 
So if you accept it, you’re less likely to have that drive to change it? I don’t know.

I have a big problem with stuff like this because in my head accepting it is basically being lazy and being kind to myself means I’m making excuses. And even if I can admit I have that problem it changes nothing about my mindset it makes me feel selfish and self centred to try and change it. 
And I can’t even work on that myself but have no therapy access ):"

","Okay. It seems like we're not talking about the same kind of acceptance. What I mean is a DBT technique of making peace with the bad possibility happening. Meaning accepting how it might indeed happen. Not that you're exactly fine with it in a sense that you want it or you're giving up. More like you mentally prepare yourself for it. For example if people with social anxiety are often scared they might say something that would make them look stupid. For that doing radical acceptance would be telling themselvels how they might indeed say something stupid. And if that happens, it's no big deal. And at the same time there must never be any reassurance seeking about how what they said was or wasn't stupid. The core of it is making peace with uncertainty, with not being sure, which is what is always comes down to. And by doing this, the scary possibilites you worry about stop being that scary. At least eventually. It takes a while to work fully."

","I find that a large part of my anxiety has me focusing on finding a name for what is wrong with me. To an extent, like with my PMDD, it makes it so I can prepare for when it's going to get bad. In the end though, a proper diagnosis only got me so far, as did meds. 

I found it easier once I got clear on what I wanted out of meeting with professionals. 

The way I see it, we always have two paths. The first is I decide what I want, and I seek out different doctors until I find one that agrees with me. 

The second is that I decide that I like the professionals I am seeing, and I take their advice, even if it doesn't feel quite right. Our minds have a defense mechanism where, when we receive information contrary to what the mind is prepared to hear, it will attempt to find anything wrong so it has an excuse to avoid the pain of uncovering what is really causing us suffering. 

With either choice, I feel empowered in knowing that it was my choice to make. I looked around and found the doctors that I like, they know my history, and I trust them. 

TL;DR If I don't like my doctors, I find new ones. If I like them, I am completely honest with them, then I hear them out and try it their way."

","“ Radical acceptance is a therapeutic technique that involves fully accepting and embracing a situation or circumstance as it is, rather than trying to change or resist it. This means acknowledging and understanding the reality of a situation, even if it is negative or painful, and then choosing to accept and respond to it in a constructive way.

The goal of radical acceptance is to reduce suffering and emotional distress by letting go of resistance to present circumstances and instead developing a sense of acceptance and mindfulness. “

Yeah I took it as accepting that’s the reality instead of the unknown stuff so thanks for clarifying 

And that’s something I could try and work on but I don’t know how possible this is given the physical symptoms. 
I’ll try it little by little"

I'm about to lose my dream job willingly due to anxiety,"Hi everyone, sorry in advance for my English, I'm not a native speaker. I just need to vent and maybe get some support. Or maybe someone could kick my ass virtually. Thanks.

I'm a 29y.o. female, I suffer from anxiety and extreme panic attacks. My whole life I was dreaming of climbing up the career ladder, making lots of money and being independent. It was never easy to get out of comfort zones, but I was kicking myself in the ass to reach my goals. Panic and anxiety tried to stop me many times but somehow I got through it. Especially with my fiance's help, he's the best thing that ever happened to me and he helped me a lot during the periods when I was getting constant panic attacks (it was so bad that a couple of times I got my whole body paralyzed). 

So I grew up really poor and was always dreaming to have a good high paying job, I started working when I was 16 selling eastern european street food in a marketplace. Then I was a waitress, bartender, then got an assistant job in the HR office when I was around 21. When I finished my tourism management studies I got a job in a travel agency, at 25 y.o. I got a job as a project manager again in an HR company, and now at 29 just a month ago I unexpectedly was offered a job as a head of process development in a big and serious company with such pay that I never could have dreamed of. I'm the bread winner in our family and with this job we could pay off our debt, travel and buy a house in a couple of years. Sounds like my dream did come true. 

BUT

This whole month that I was working here I was on the edge psychologically, there is A LOT of responsibility, way more than I expected, so much stress and I was feeling that it's too much for me and this whole week I was driving home crying from all the stress. It's mainly because I'm not used to that much of responsibility and there are A LOT of things that I don't know yet and it's driving me crazy. So today I snapped and told my boss that I don't want to work here anymore. I even considered being unemployed and for a couple of months just to relax my brain. My boss is very calm and supportive and after a long talk he suggested me to wait till monday and think of my decision through the weekend.

So I'm sitting here wondering what to do, I will never get this kind of opportunity again, I really don't want to mess this up and it's all I ever wanted (career and money-wise), but I feel like I will burn out quickly and will start getting panick attacks again. 

Sorry for the long post, but maybe someone had a similar situation? How did that turn out for you?","firstly, congratulations. that’s a big deal and whether or not you go for it, you should feel proud that you are a valuable person that is clearly sought after. 

secondly, i understand 100%. i have turned down/left so many jobs due to anxiety because it was just too much, i was inconsolable, the stress (or literally just the *potential* of stress) felt like far more than i could manage and i would turn back. honestly, as much as i don’t judge myself for those decisions, i regret a lot of them. i wish i had had more faith in myself. i wish i’d just given those things a chance. 

i believe that if you take that job, you will be able to handle it. you will be surprised by your capabilities once the fear subsides. you’ll be proud of yourself and you’ll earn good money. and if you don’t like it, you can leave. 

having said that, if you’d rather stay at your current job there is nothing wrong with that either. both options are a sacrifice. it depends which one you’re willing to make. 

you will have so many opportunities in your future - these are just phases! there is so much growth in facing your fears and trying something new. you never know what will come after. i hope i get that courage too someday. 

wishing you all the best - let us know what you decide :)"
It's going to be one of those nights again,"So im again terrified but not on the brink of having a panic attack (yet) but anyways what happened was that without reason to or without knowing why I started feeling very ill just 10 minutes ago.

The shock and bewilderment you get from witnessing something like that can stick with you for awhile.

However, i was in such a bad state mentally, i was ready to take any side effects as long as i felt okay mentally. In the first week, the major side effects were - increase in tremors (I already had them owing to anxiety), disruption in sleep (hated this, slept only for 4-5 hours), dizziness, a slight increase in anxiety but that was taken care of by Etizolam which has been prescribed with Prozac. Apart from this, headaches were common. The first few weeks are difficult to get by, but you need to push through cause once the meds kick in, you get your normal self back. I really, really hope your anxiety resolves very soon. In case you want to know anything else, do lemme know. Take care!"

Can someone please just tell me everything will work out and be okay?,"Hi. 

I had nerve repair surgery 4 days ago in my mouth. I have been an anxious wreck ever since I woke up from the surgery. 

First, my eye was scratched during the surgery, and I couldn’t see for a few days due to the scratch. I can finally see today, but now I’m horrified of my eye getting scratched again and dealing with that excruciating pain.

Second, I haven’t been able to get in contact with my doctor about getting in for a post-op to get my stitches out. I have called several times throughout the week with nobody responding to me. I understand it’s thanksgiving this week, but I just hate not having things figured out. My doctor is only seeing post-ops and consults one day a week, and I don’t want to have to wait weeks to get my stitches out. 

Third, I have to go back to university on Sunday. I have a presentation to give on Monday, and an exam on Thursday. I am freaking out about being back to school with all of my stitches still in my mouth and still feeling terrible. I’m eating pretty well for my position, but I’m consistently nauseous and scared about going back to school. 

I’m also fiending for my vape. I haven’t hit it since before the surgery, and I just want it so bad but I’m scared to screw up my stitches. Ugh I’m terrible","hello, everything will work out for you and fall into place. have trust in this"

Any kind words and tips would definitely help. Mad love everyone ❤️",That’s honestly a good idea!! I haven’t thought about that yet. Thank you! I’ll look into it

Im having Panic attacks and Derealisating and I dont know why,"I feel like this all started when I was ill during the summer, and would wake up from a dream every other night thinking I was dead. When I was better which took like a week and a half the dreams stopped. Ive actually had these dream as long as I can remember but it would only happen like 2 to maybe 5 times a year, but because they were so frequent when I was ill, I haven’t really felt the same since. Ive been smoking weed since I was 13 and Im 15 now and this year Ive been smoking weed alot to make me less depressed about my life. At the start of last week I bought a weed pen and it ran out last weekend. I havent had any weed since and this whole week Ive felt like everyone around me hates me and I also feel outside of my own body. Last night I had one of my bad dreams and Today in my last class of schoola all of my movements felt really slow and heavy. When I got home from school I was home alone and was out of my mind making weird humming sounds, crying, I was panicking on the floor and my dogs were in my face freaking me out. The only thing I can compare it to is recently in an exam my breathing felt really fast and I felt like everyone was looking at me. Right now I still feel weird but Ive definitley calmed down. Does anyone know what is happening to me? ","Using weed as a coping mechanism is worse than bad for You. I smoked for years and years, on a daily basis, but never with the goal of feeling better about life, instead just going for the fun of it. Stopping smoking means You cut out Your coping mechanism and now have to face life in its raw form. The thing about smoking weed is that it trains You to be a bit too relaxed about everything, which is less than ideal for real life. A moderate amount of care, wariness and tolerance of stress is necessary; going into life without these qualities means You risk getting traumatized by stresses so intensely that they stick with You, and You compensate by being TOO anxious, TOO wary and TOO expectant of stress.

I was not any older when I had smoked, however it does not change the fact that You are WAY too young for smoking weed. While I have never had withdrawal symptoms other than intense dreams, that does not mean someone else won't - especially someone who started smoking heavily at 13.

My advice is drop weed ASAP and consult professional assistance if Your problems persist, or get worse. Things may calm down, but You are obviously not equipped to handle life properly if You must rely on substances to get through the week. You may not need professional assistance if You get Your act together in time, but this will require You to become aware of the fact that You are abusing weed and not just enjoying it, and that Your mental state is compromised for whatever reason. It will also require You to take actual steps towards changing this, such as dropping weed until You can function properly without it, and afterwards regulating its use, and utilizing introspection and other forms of problem analysis in order to work on whatever put You in this state of needing weed to get through the week. However, offend You as this may, I believe someone of Your age simply does not have the required perspective and life experience to apply this to themselves, and I most strongly advise dropping weed altogether and getting professional help."

It’s like when i’m not occupied with doing something I get stuck in a deep rabbit hole with my own thoughts and make myself sad again. I also have nerve pain from this summer of being ill and have had acid reflux for like a year. So that makes it so much worse it makes u feel like you’re actually dying.

Medications Not Working,"26F
I have had anxiety my whole life but have always self managed without meds. I tried sertraline for a few months at 19 but couldn't sleep and had constant headaches. About a year ago I had a knee surgery gone wrong in 2023 that resulted in a nerve injury and severe nerve pain, which I am still working on getting figured out. I then herniated a disk in my lower back and spiraled downward due to the pain. Sometime in there I noticed my arms and face started having burning sensations and was never able to find an answer to. I also have had trouble falling asleep lately. I have been tested for autoimmune disorders, with no noticeable answers. It feels like it is mostly anxiety/chronic stress causing these symptoms.

In July, right after my back injury, my doctor prescribed Cymbalta. It was helpful for anxiety, but not physical symptoms necessarily. I also had some bad side effects with it such as a racing heart and headaches. The withdrawal off of it was worse. I then tried buspirone, but it had no effect. My doctor then switched to Lexapro most recently, but I made the personal decision to stop as I fell deeper into depression and didn't sleep for 2 weeks, with no help. 

My mom is trying to convince me I have fibromyalgia due to the arms/face burning, back pain and leg pain. She also thinks the not sleeping is part of it. I have bad health anxiety. I already looked at the symptoms of fibromyalgia and I don't think they fully match and feel like I just need to get anxiety under control better and allow my body to heal. I have a friend/medical provider who thinks I'm stuck in fight or flight from anxiety, as many of my symptoms don't always make sense

Has anyone had any luck with finding a medication that worked for both the physical and mental aspects of anxiety that don't have bad side effects. I think cymbalta worked best but many of the nerve problems I experience are better in the summer so it is hard to be sure if cymbalta actually helped.

TLDR: tried 3 meds(cymbalta, buspirone and lexapro) that didn't work. I have what I believe are physical manifestations of anxiety. Anyone have any good medications.","Everyone has different reactions to these meds, so trying to find one that everyone agrees on is, unfortunately, impossible. Propranolol might work for the physical side effects of anxiety. Mental side, you'll need to find an SSRI that'll work for you, and it takes some trial and error sometimes. There is also a dna test, Genesight, that will help ID which meds might work better with fewer side effects based on your genetics."
Anxiety ,"For the past week I have not been able to do simple tasks and I have not had an appetite or thirst but I am still forcing myself to eat and drink

","Yes. I’ve been dealing with this for years. Had all these same feelings. Started taking escitalopram in late 2019. Definitely helped. I had my life back. Stopped taking it in Feb of this year and it went down hill from there. Reason is because I didn’t taper off like I should have and it came back with a force. Not to mention there were other things that were happening that increased my anxiety. Started taking escitalopram again in late Sept. it’s been a little over 9 weeks and I feel so much better. Stick with the medication, don’t stop taking it. It may be rough now but trust you will get better."

","I’d say it was the anxiety at first because I had become so nauseous and couldn’t focus. My appetite was completely gone. Lost weight and felt like a shell of myself. I was really in the dumps. I’d drink juice, ginger ale, and water. I’d also eat saltines. Soups helped. I can’t really say it was the medication because my anxiety and stress was at an all time high. I started drinking chamomile tea and stuck with it and started getting my appetite back. It’s definitely a process."
"Job anxiety, looking for advice","I started working my first ‘real’ job after leaving college in August this year, I’m currently a bartender. Ever since I started, I’ve liked the job itself but the people ruin it all for me. My manager is so nasty to everyone, including customers. I could go on a full rant about all of the things she’s said to me and other people but just to give you some perspective, she’s made me cry multiple times at work and she actively threatens to make me cry again every time I work with her. She plays things like this off as a joke in front of other people but it’s really affecting my mental health. I’m constantly drained and cry 90% of the time before I go into work, and even on my days off I’m anxious and overwhelmed about my next shift.

Should I quit? I’m really nervous about quitting and being unable to find another job since it took over 3 months of me applying to jobs to get this one. I don’t know what to do, it’s starting to affect my daily life and mental health badly.","i get how tough it can be with a manager like that... i started using the Inner Journey app last month and it really helps with stress and anxiety. it’s got great tools for mental clarity and emotional balance, which might help u cope better at work."

"Can’t get a psychiatrist, it’s been months and I’ve tried everything ","I have severe anxiety as well as a myriad of other mental health conditions. I’ve been in therapy / on meds since I was like 12 (I’m now 28). I had a great psychiatrist at one point years ago but he moved states so I had to stop seeing him and since then it’s just been BAD. I’ve had nobody take me seriously and basically just try to force me back on the same 2 SSRI’s that I told them gave me bad side effects. I don’t even take a benzo or an opiate or anything right now but I’ve still been told I’m “drug seeking” (not in those exact words but basically) and it’s driving me crazy.

 I just want someone who takes me seriously I’ve never once asked to be put on any specific medication and even said I DONT wanna be on a benzo. I haven’t had a psychiatrist in 2 months now because my last one wouldn’t even up my dose of the antidepressant that wasn’t helping me. she just kept telling me I need to take walks for at least an hour a day . when i explained to her so many times I’m having trouble even leaving my house and that’s super overwhelming. I thought “well I’ve found someone new before this sucks but I’ll have to do it again” but yeah no I literally can’t find anyone. 

I’ve called my insurance company multiple times and even they can’t get ahold of anyone who actually takes my insurance. It’s been months like I said and nobody can seem to get through to anyone (my mom, me, my insurance company). My insurance company is saying if I get a psychiatrist to write to them with a prior approval for out of network care then maybe it will get approved but that’s super unlikely and also I CANT EVEN GET THROUGH TO ANYONE AT ALL ANYWAY. I don’t know what to do I’m at a loss 😭😭 I can’t function and I just cry most of the time. I wasn’t doing well before but I’m getting worse and worse pretty much everyday. Having to even make any phone call is hard but to repeatedly have to do it and then get ignored or told nobody can help you is beyond exhausting. ","Even if you need a benzodiazepine everyday it’s not a bad thing, they’re extremely effective drugs for people with true panic disorders / disabling anxiety. I’ve been on Xanax 1mg 3x daily for years without loss of efficacy for anxiety relief. Find a doctor that works with you not against you, there are bad doctors just like every profession has good and bad. 

You are not drug seeking if benzodiazepines treat your condition and you use them therapeutically to calm down. Don’t let anyone tell you that your an addict because you depend on a medication that greatly improves your quality of life and makes you feel better. Physical and psychological dependency and drug addiction / abuse are separate concepts. Antidepressants cause physical dependency the same way benzodiazepines do if not abused.

I’ve been in therapy / on meds since I was like 12 (I’m now 28). I had a great psychiatrist at one point years ago but he moved states so I had to stop seeing him and since then it’s just been BAD. I’ve had nobody take me seriously and basically just try to force me back on the same 2 SSRI’s that I told them gave me bad side effects. I don’t even take a benzo or an opiate or anything right now but I’ve still been told I’m “drug seeking” (not in those exact words but basically) and it’s driving me crazy.

 I just want someone who takes me seriously I’ve never once asked to be put on any specific medication and even said I DONT wanna be on a benzo. I haven’t had a psychiatrist in 2 months now because my last one wouldn’t even up my dose of the antidepressant that wasn’t helping me. she just kept telling me I need to take walks for at least an hour a day . when i explained to her so many times I’m having trouble even leaving my house and that’s super overwhelming. I thought “well I’ve found someone new before this sucks but I’ll have to do it again” but yeah no I literally can’t find anyone. 

I’ve called my insurance company multiple times and even they can’t get ahold of anyone who actually takes my insurance. It’s been months like I said and nobody can seem to get through to anyone (my mom, me, my insurance company). My insurance company is saying if I get a psychiatrist to write to them with a prior approval for out of network care then maybe it will get approved but that’s super unlikely and also I CANT EVEN GET THROUGH TO ANYONE AT ALL ANYWAY. I don’t know what to do I’m at a loss 😭😭 I can’t function and I just cry most of the time. I wasn’t doing well before but I’m getting worse and worse pretty much everyday. Having to even make any phone call is hard but to repeatedly have to do it and then get ignored or told nobody can help you is beyond exhausting. ",Exact same deal with me and the only psychiatrist appointment isn't until middle March

",You aren’t wrong at all I know they can be effective but I got shit for being on Gabapentin when it was helping me. To the point where I got bullied out of taking it because they just wouldn’t prescribe it to me (after my psychiatrist of years prescribing it to me FOR years and never thinking twice about it because it was helping). From what I know and I really could be wrong but I think benzos are even more stigmatized which is sad but if they won’t prescribe me anything “harder” then an antidepressant idk that they’d be cool with me literally asking for a benzo. A big part of it I think is the fact that I have bad insurance (when it comes to mental health especially) and the doctors that do take my insurance have been awful but most don’t even take my insurance to begin with.

","Don’t give up and keep looking for a doctor until one gives you what you need. That’s unacceptable if you weren’t abusing pills to get high.. and you said you took it for years? Shame on them.

Don’t ask for benzos and see an MD not NPs. Nurse practitioners really stigmatize these more than MD psychiatrists do."

","I know it’s gross my mom is a literal therapist and she’s SO angry for me because she knows better than anyone that I never abused it. Apparently “new studies” are coming out about how it causes brain fog and can be addictive but I never abused it or I’m pretty sure my pharmacy would’ve stopped giving it to me first of all.  I was on it for literally 3 years and never had an issue with abusing it or wanting too. It didn’t even make me feel “high” I just felt normal for once.

I’m a bad reader and adhd so I literally just saw the part of your comment about the NP but trust me I learned that the hard way 😭 the person who I saw after the psychiatrist I had for years was an NP and she’s the one who force me to stop taking the medication and since then I haven’t been able to get it prescribed the other two psychiatrists I’ve tried seeing."

I mentioned in another comment but my mom is a therapist but she’s a genuinely good one who is disgusted more than most people at the state of our mental health care system. She’s not once of these “rich” therapists but still will come up with a reasonable payment plan for people who can’t afford expensive healthcare. If they don’t have much income , fine she’s making 10 dollars a week from them and she’s okay with that. It hurts me to know so many people suffer trying to find healthcare professionals who take them seriously 😭"

","it’s partially I think because it seems there been an uptake in drug abuse but most of the people abusing drugs are getting them off the streets, not prescribed. Yes sometimes it starts that way but usually it doesn’t seem like thats the case. Now it’s hard to get any help unless you are only “slightly & mildly seasonally depressed”. Anything more than that and you get a run around and nobody wants to help because they’re afraid if your in the minority that does abuse the medication they will lose their license 🙄 basically they are cowards"
"Can’t get a psychiatrist, it’s been months and I’ve tried everything ","I have severe anxiety as well as a myriad of other mental health conditions. I’ve been in therapy / on meds since I was like 12 (I’m now 28). I had a great psychiatrist at one point years ago but he moved states so I had to stop seeing him and since then it’s just been BAD. I’ve had nobody take me seriously and basically just try to force me back on the same 2 SSRI’s that I told them gave me bad side effects. I don’t even take a benzo or an opiate or anything right now but I’ve still been told I’m “drug seeking” (not in those exact words but basically) and it’s driving me crazy.

 I just want someone who takes me seriously I’ve never once asked to be put on any specific medication and even said I DONT wanna be on a benzo. I haven’t had a psychiatrist in 2 months now because my last one wouldn’t even up my dose of the antidepressant that wasn’t helping me. she just kept telling me I need to take walks for at least an hour a day . when i explained to her so many times I’m having trouble even leaving my house and that’s super overwhelming. I thought “well I’ve found someone new before this sucks but I’ll have to do it again” but yeah no I literally can’t find anyone. 

I’ve called my insurance company multiple times and even they can’t get ahold of anyone who actually takes my insurance. It’s been months like I said and nobody can seem to get through to anyone (my mom, me, my insurance company). My insurance company is saying if I get a psychiatrist to write to them with a prior approval for out of network care then maybe it will get approved but that’s super unlikely and also I CANT EVEN GET THROUGH TO ANYONE AT ALL ANYWAY. I don’t know what to do I’m at a loss 😭😭 I can’t function and I just cry most of the time. I wasn’t doing well before but I’m getting worse and worse pretty much everyday. Having to even make any phone call is hard but to repeatedly have to do it and then get ignored or told nobody can help you is beyond exhausting. ","Funny you say that cause doctor said he wouldn't prescribe any benzos which I didn't even ask for, I've never done any drugs in my life not even weed I was an athlete, don't drink alcohol or soda ever, just water and low cal Gatorade and maybe a cup of decaf coffee"
Bit worried after doctors appointment ,"I've been referred for a Holter monitor which I expected but the also said they're sending me to cardiology regardless of the result. 

Then they asked me about family history of young deaths (hasn't been any) or heart problems (mums dad and 2 uncles on grandma side had). 

Is this all normal procedure and I'm just worrying over nothing?","Normal, especially with heart problems in the family"

Is this all normal procedure and I'm just worrying over nothing?",Don’t worry! This is good news. It sounds like your drs are doing the right thing and are just being cautious. Cardiology will evaluate holter and likely do an echo (ultrasound for heart) and ekg. These are pretty routine in the cardiology world and just something your dr likely doesn’t have the tech to do. Most times nothing comes from it and you’ll feel good with a clean bill of health. Doctors don’t want to (nor should) mess around when it comes to the heart so always best they’re overly cautious instead of doing nothing.

I feel sick.","This has to be ""faced"" in your head. Meaning you have to embrace that it happened and there is no way around that. Not trying to convince yourself how it's not embarrassing or anything. Just accept it's embarrassing and try leaving it on that note."

Landed an interview for my dream job and I cannot let my anxiety ruin this for me!,"Somehow, miraculously, I am through to the final round of interviews for my dream job! I applied back in May, got through to the first stage, and then didn't hear anything back so I assumed that was that. Yesterday I got a call from a number I didn't recognise so I ignored it thinking it was spam. Turns out it was the company that I applied to work for. I called them back and got thrown into a surprise phone interview that I passed?? Me??? Queen of Crippling Anxiety??? So next Wednesday afternoon I have my final interview and already my heart is racing, my stomach is in knots, and I wanna throw up.

Annoyingly the first thought in my head was ""well I just won't attend the interview"" like no you moron this is your dream job!! If you'd have told me 5 years ago I was through to the final round of interviews for this role I'd have simply passed away from shock. But I cannot lose my head. The opportunity, the role, the company, omg the wage, I cannot let this pass me by. Now of all times I need to ignore my anxiety, because yes I can do this, and start practicing answers. If I can pass a surprise phone interview I can pass a measly 8 question interview, right?

I'm on sertraline but couldn't be prescribed beta blockers because of my asthma. I could really do with those right now! Wish me luck <3",U got this bubs

Anyone get jealous of people who are not dealing with daily anxiety?,,"The guy I'm seeing has absolutely no idea what anxiety is. I take 2 medications to keep me basically well enough to function through my anxiety. 
He's never experienced the absolute panic and stress and physical dysfunction that comes with severe anxiety so he kind of took it as a joke, like ""just relax"". 

He's understanding more now that I was off my meds for two days and was a panic disorder anxiety mess.. 

Just someone who's never been through/dealt with anxiety. 
It's wild to me with his hectic life he hasn't been struck with anxiety or panic. 

He handles every situation very very well. I'm happy he doesn't go through what some of us go though 💕lucky one."

Anyone get jealous of people who are not dealing with daily anxiety?,,yes but everyone has their own problems
Anyone get jealous of people who are not dealing with daily anxiety?,,YES. My husband handles his anxiety much better than I handle mine. He can also do simple things that my anxiety stops me from. I'm so envious of that
Anyone get jealous of people who are not dealing with daily anxiety?,,">Anyone get jealous of people who are not dealing with daily anxiety?

I lived with anxiety my whole life up until two years ago, when I started HIT treatment.  Notes:

* It affected every aspect of my life & dictated much of what I did
* A year or two ago, I went to Times Square, at midnight, around a thousand people.  No anxiety.  No panic.  Thinking wasn't disabled.  No overwhelming urge to bolt.  No awful feelings.  It BOGGLED MY MIND that people just LIVE like this!!
* It's **incredibly** hard for people to fathom something that doesn't constantly affect them.

In addition:

* I can still be pushed into it, in extreme situations.
* I still have PPA (Public Performance Anxiety).  I do lectures, classes, and presentations in groups of 10 to 500 people.  Still hate the experience, but it is FAR more tolerable on anxiety treatment.
* I haven't had a panic attack in 2 years.  Going grocery shopping or driving doesn't feel terrible.  My automatic hypervigilance is disabled.

What I've learned:

* Growing up, my entire definition of ""normal"" was COMPLETELY warped because everything just felt awful ALL the time.
* ""Normal"" people can literally **just push through things** because *it's not showstopping for them* & they don't live in Awful Town 24/7.  It's like eating a peanut when you're allergic vs. not allergic...just a TOTALLY different experience!
* For me, my anxiety was external (driven by my body), not by thinking. It warped my thinking, my negative emotions overrode my ability to think clearly & rationally, and it caused automatic rumination.  It basically feels like hot branding irons.  This is what people don't understand: it's like walking barefoot down a hallway lined with Legos.  It's not something you can just ""turn off"" or ""stop thinking about"".

It's difficult for people who don't live with it to empathize because it's like living in an entirely different dimension.  The last 2 years of my life have been entirely different under effective treatment.  I can go places & do things emotionally pain-free.  I don't get shut down in public situations.  I now understand why people without anxiety can do what they do...because they don't *experience* what we do!"

I’ve rarely had this peace. I believe that God fully is aware he added that anxiety spice to me and wants me to work on it, but I wish I could give away worries to him easier.

It’s weird honestly cause I can get over tangible things MUCH quicker than things in my head. Actual loss is something I can grieve through, but worries? Those just stick."

Anyone get jealous of people who are not dealing with daily anxiety?,,"Histamine intolerance (HIT) is a sister condition to MCAS (Mast Cell Activation Syndrome).  I'm DAO deficient, so I take a DAO enzyme.  I'm not sure if links are allowed in this sub, but my profile has a pinned post (table of contents) with more information (search for ""histamine intolerance"" & ""histamine protocol""), as it's currently a niche condition.

Essentially:

* My body doesn't make enough DAO to absorb the histamine in food
* It then goes into my bloodstream instead of my gut
* This goofs me up in 50 different ways lol

The treatment is:

* Take a high-HDU enzyme every few hours (little enzyme pill 5 times down)
* After 72 hours, the system-wide inflammation goes down
* I have to be on this permanently

Notes:

* There is currently no clinical test available
* The enzyme is OTC; it takes less than a week to see if it works.  If that doesn't work (you can get a refund FYI), the second course of action is to test the various antihistamines on the market (antihistamines were ineffective for me personally, but not everyone responds to the enzyme path)
* My primary symptoms are anxiety, insomnia, and brain fog, all of which go away after a few days on the protocol.  There's not really any in-between; it either works, or not

I had **no clue** my anxiety was food-related.  That explained why it was *variable*; sometimes I would have good days & bad days, and sometimes the bad days were REALLY bad for no apparent reason.

* I no longer feel constantly judged or criticized all the time for no reason
* I no longer feel terrible driving, going to the grocery store, or being in crowds
* I no longer get anxiety at bedtime, remember cringy memories at night, have time anxiety (i.e. have to go to bed, so I have to wake up, then I get stuck in an anxious loop), or have health anxiety (swallowing pills, body issues feeling like the end of the world, etc.)

This was just my *normal*; it was simply ""how life was"" for me.  Everything was difficult & painful.  I'd come home exhausted after dealing with people all day.  HIT treatment isn't the root cause for everybody, but it's an easy at-home test to at least rule out & move on from!"

She would be laughing and joking and then something like that will ruin her day.

","I’ve used CBD oils with concentrations ranging from 10% to 30% from the brand Eusphera during moments of anxiety or stress. They’ve helped me feel more relaxed and calm without causing drowsiness or making me feel sluggish. What I find most valuable is that, being natural, they are gentle on the body and the digestive system, which makes them easy to use as part of my routine. I don’t see a psychologist because my anxiety isn’t severe, but after discussing it with my doctor, I was advised to try this kind of product."

Convince I will be fired from work because I have COVID,I called out from work today because I am sick with COVID. I have the sick time to cover the day but if you call out the day after a holiday you don't get paid for the holiday unless you turn in a doctor's note. I went to urgent care and got a note that said I should stay home until my symptoms improve and emailed it in but I still feel like I'm going to be in big trouble. It doesn't make any sense. I hate anxiety so much. I did nothing wrong yet I am convinced I'm going to be fired.,you’re okay. you did every thing that you needed to do. rest up and focus on getting better. your job will still be there  🫶

How to get past freeze? ,"I (F26) have been struggling with freezing when faced with a decision or social situations. For instance, I showed up for a ten minute meeting five minutes late, couldn’t decide whether to go in late or just miss it, and sat in my car for forty-five minutes with worsening anxiety because I literally couldn’t make myself do one or the other. I did the same thing trying to visit a new coffee shop, but couldn’t decide whether it would be weird to take my back pack in or not. I sat in my car for close to an hour before admitting defeat and just leaving. 
I have had a lot of life changes this year, I left two long-time jobs (one I was at for three years, the other for five), started full-time schooling as a university freshman, and had some major family life drama. I think I’m just a bit overwhelmed, but I need help figuring out how to get past this weird freeze thing, as it’s starting to take over my life. 😫 ",I would also like to know how to deal with this.

Should I go on medication?,"
I’ve had anxiety and depression for about five years now. I’ve never been officially diagnosed but I feel like this is something you just know you have when you feel it. 

When I first started having anxiety it was so horrible I couldn’t even leave the house (15F at the time, now 20F) and I had anxiety from the moment I woke up to the moment I fell asleep. During the Covid lockdown I actually did better since I didn’t have to go anywhere and my anxiety and depression calmed down as I was constantly surrounded by family and life was on pause for everyone. Going into my senior year of highschool was horrible for me and I was absent about half of the year due to my anxiety. 

My anxiety is something that stops me from doing simple things, it’s a lot better than it was when I was 15 but even then it stops me from doing stuff. For example there’s still times when I don’t want to go anywhere because of this dull anxiety that clings to my nerves or going to the movies makes me anxious and I must bring earbuds with me in order to calm down. It stopped me from starting college until now and it makes me worried about my future. 

Depression is also something I struggle with, though my anxiety was always the main issue, the last few days it’s been my depression that’s been acting up really badly. Although it’s not as bad as when I was 15, it’s definitely worse than it’s been in a while as it’s been days since I started feeling like this. Whenever my anxiety acts up really badly I always think of going on meds but I never do (taboo in my family, my parents don’t understand this sort of thing) but my depression the last few days is making me feel so horrible I’m genuinely considering it. 

I very recently moved (it’s been about two weeks) and I think this is what triggered this huge depressive episode. Being uprooted from comfortability really set something off in me and even though I know it’s ridiculous (I literally moved across the street) I can’t help the way I feel. 

The thing is, aside from my parents opinions (I live with my father and as I’m in school he provides for me and would be the one paying for any medication and taking me to appointments) I’m also really scared to go on medication. I did once go to the ER for a panic attack and they prescribed me anxiety medication but I never took it because I was scared of what it’d do to me, which is the main issue. I’m terrified it’s going to make me feel worse as I’ve seen so many people say. If I’m feeling depressed and anxious now I can only imagine what the wrong medication might do to me. I’m really hoping this rut of mine ends soon but it’s hard living like this and not feeling doomed, especially when I’m so busy with school and have about a million assignments due very soon.

Any suggestions? Even just some comfort would be nice honestly. ","Hello, if you have had anxiety for five years then most likely yes. My psychiatrist told me people usually need it if they've been having anxiety on regular basis for longer than 6 months. Though in the end it's doctor's decision to presribe it or not. But I'm sure you would be prescribed it. 

I understand you're afraid. Good thing is you can just stop taking it if anything. As a result any bad side effect or reaction would most likely stop very quickly. So in that sense you're not risking much by trying it. And if it ends up working, it's so worth it. To me it gave me my life back. Also you would probably be given secondary medication for more of a direct and immediate relief in case your anxiety got bad, so you could use that in case of a bad reaction. So it's like a safe guard."

Whenever my anxiety acts up really badly I always think of going on meds but I never do (taboo in my family, my parents don’t understand this sort of thing) but my depression the last few days is making me feel so horrible I’m genuinely considering it. 

I very recently moved (it’s been about two weeks) and I think this is what triggered this huge depressive episode. Being uprooted from comfortability really set something off in me and even though I know it’s ridiculous (I literally moved across the street) I can’t help the way I feel. 

The thing is, aside from my parents opinions (I live with my father and as I’m in school he provides for me and would be the one paying for any medication and taking me to appointments) I’m also really scared to go on medication. I did once go to the ER for a panic attack and they prescribed me anxiety medication but I never took it because I was scared of what it’d do to me, which is the main issue. I’m terrified it’s going to make me feel worse as I’ve seen so many people say. If I’m feeling depressed and anxious now I can only imagine what the wrong medication might do to me. I’m really hoping this rut of mine ends soon but it’s hard living like this and not feeling doomed, especially when I’m so busy with school and have about a million assignments due very soon.

Any suggestions? Even just some comfort would be nice honestly. ",Ah I see. So I’d have the main medication I’d be taking and then a backup medication for sudden huge spikes in anxiety?
Should I go on medication?,"
I’ve had anxiety and depression for about five years now. I’ve never been officially diagnosed but I feel like this is something you just know you have when you feel it. 

When I first started having anxiety it was so horrible I couldn’t even leave the house (15F at the time, now 20F) and I had anxiety from the moment I woke up to the moment I fell asleep. During the Covid lockdown I actually did better since I didn’t have to go anywhere and my anxiety and depression calmed down as I was constantly surrounded by family and life was on pause for everyone. Going into my senior year of highschool was horrible for me and I was absent about half of the year due to my anxiety. 

My anxiety is something that stops me from doing simple things, it’s a lot better than it was when I was 15 but even then it stops me from doing stuff. For example there’s still times when I don’t want to go anywhere because of this dull anxiety that clings to my nerves or going to the movies makes me anxious and I must bring earbuds with me in order to calm down. It stopped me from starting college until now and it makes me worried about my future. 

Depression is also something I struggle with, though my anxiety was always the main issue, the last few days it’s been my depression that’s been acting up really badly. Although it’s not as bad as when I was 15, it’s definitely worse than it’s been in a while as it’s been days since I started feeling like this. Whenever my anxiety acts up really badly I always think of going on meds but I never do (taboo in my family, my parents don’t understand this sort of thing) but my depression the last few days is making me feel so horrible I’m genuinely considering it.

Any suggestions? Even just some comfort would be nice honestly. ",Yes exactly. In some cases the secondary medication is taken daily no matter what to sort of kickstart the effect of the main medication. In other cases only during the spikes.
I've had terrible anxiety and guilt for a month and idk where it's coming from. ,"!I'm reposting this from r/equestrian because I didn't get any attention there! 

I'm just hoping someone might know what's happening to me or has experienced something even relatively similar. I need help.

I'm not sure why I have been having these feelings. I want to cry right now because for the last month or so I've been feeling all this and I'm not sure where it's coming from but it's definitely connected to horseriding and horses. I don't own or lease a horse. For now I'm just going for lessons.

For context you could read my previous post on r/equestrian if you're not scared of long stories, I posted about 2 days ago about this but I suppose I worded it wrong.

This heartsinking feeling has been here for a month straight now and I just don't know what to do. I think I've tried everything and it goes away only when I'm at the stable riding or near horses. Idk know why, good god I'm tearing up wth. I know you all aren't therapists and can't help, but I'm just hoping someone has any tips of getting better or just what to do in my situation or something else to say. I'm desperate at this pint.

The feeling is always there. At day it's better because I have school so I am distracted but when I have to go to sleep and don't have anything to distract my mind with I find my heart just racing andaching almost. Idk what this feeling is since I've never had it before now, but I'm guessing it could be anxiety...? Idk what to do.

I'm not really a super anxious person by nature. If 5 was normal and 10 extreme I would be anywhere from 4-6 in level of anxiety. But lately I've been at 7+. I really don't know what to do.

I just want to feel better.",Maybe it's because of pressure?

Anyone Experience a Single Ectopic Beat While Working Out or in Anxious Situations?,"Hey everyone,

I’m curious if anyone else has experienced a single ectopic beat (a flutter or extra beat) while working out, during anxious moments, or sometimes when bending over. I’ve noticed this happening to me occasionally, particularly after exercises like shoulder presses or when I stand up quickly after resting the weights on my lap. It also tends to happen when I’m feeling nervous.

For some background, I’ve had extensive heart testing done, including a 24-hour Holter monitor, an echocardiogram, EKGs, and a cardiac MRI (CMR). All the results came back normal, which is reassuring, but the sensation can still be unsettling.

I’m wondering if this is something others have experienced and how you manage it. Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks! Anyone know what to do about them 😭","I have had this on and off since I was 12 years old and yes, sometimes exercise, certain movements, even indigestion can trigger them. I have been checked out many times and they are benign palpitations. You really can't do anything about them. I have even had them non-stop for weeks. Just got through a recent bout. Always avoid caffeine and don't try and ""rest"" them away, it doesn't help. Continue exercising normally and try to not focus on them. I know it's hard but focusing on them only makes them worse."

Heart palpitation/stomach twitching. Internal vibrations ,"Hello everyone,
I’m wondering if anyone here has experienced what I’ve been going through or if you have any insights into what might have helped or what your diagnosis was.

Over the past three months, I’ve gone to the ER twice. In August, I started having strange chest sensations, like palpitations that felt like they were coming from my stomach to my chest and would take my breath away. It happened with even the smallest exertion—combing my hair or being in a fast-moving car triggered it. I went to the ER, but they said everything was normal and advised me to follow up with my primary care doctor.

I couldn’t see my PCP on the weekend, so I went to his urgent care. He prescribed metoprolol for palpitations also since my bp was 137/85. The metoprolol seemed to help initially, but two weeks later, I started having shortness of breath and a feeling of chest constriction. I ended up in the ER again and was admitted for two nights.

They ran a bunch of tests:

CT scans (upper chest and abdomen)

EKG

Leg ultrasound (my D-dimer was elevated, so they wanted to rule out clots)


Everything came back normal. I was discharged with a diagnosis of tachycardia and dyspnea, but they weren’t sure of the diagnosis.  Hospital cardiologist told me to lose weight. Lost 40 pounds from August 25 to November 29. 

I’m still feeling the same symptoms, but they seem to worsen around ovulation. I feel so depressed because sometimes I can’t even lay flat without shortness of breath. Occasionally, when I take a deep breath, I feel a palpitation—it’s a sinking feeling in my chest that makes me sit up suddenly. I get stomach twitching like upper stomach. And I get internal vibrations like my back. 

Has anyone experienced something similar or have any idea what this might be? Any advice or insights would mean the world to me.
","Before my anxiety and the sources were diagnosed, I thought I was suffering from indigestion. My stomach fell full, or off the whole time. It was painful at times. It was only at night, around supper that my body would override my stomach and say, you got to eat. It wasn't until I was crying almost daily, and then went to a counselor that things started to clear up. Once I talked through what I was feeling, and we identified the source of my anxiety (initial source) all of my stomach issues went away. Still, when my anxiety flairs up, I'll get heart palapitations, shortness of breadth, stomach issues, and even sweating. It goes away by the afternoon. My Dr said that anxiety can be a really powerful affect on the body. She's had people who had all of the symptoms of a heart attack, and it was a panic attack. So, maybe, try counseling. Talk it out."

It happened with even the smallest exertion—combing my hair or being in a fast-moving car triggered it. I went to the ER, but they said everything was normal and advised me to follow up with my primary care doctor.

I couldn’t see my PCP on the weekend, so I went to his urgent care. He prescribed metoprolol for palpitations also since my bp was 137/85. The metoprolol seemed to help initially, but two weeks later, I started having shortness of breath and a feeling of chest constriction. I ended up in the ER again and was admitted for two nights.

They ran a bunch of tests:

CT scans (upper chest and abdomen)

EKG

Leg ultrasound (my D-dimer was elevated, so they wanted to rule out clots)


Everything came back normal. I was discharged with a diagnosis of tachycardia and dyspnea, but they weren’t sure of the diagnosis.  Hospital cardiologist told me to lose weight. Lost 40 pounds from August 25 to November 29. 

I’m still feeling the same symptoms, but they seem to worsen around ovulation. I feel so depressed because sometimes I can’t even lay flat without shortness of breath. Occasionally, when I take a deep breath, I feel a palpitation—it’s a sinking feeling in my chest that makes me sit up suddenly. I get stomach twitching like upper stomach. And I get internal vibrations like my back. 

Has anyone experienced something similar or have any idea what this might be? Any advice or insights would mean the world to me.
",I’m the same as you. Had all tests ran on me and it all lead back to anxiety. I went to the ER 3x in one week. All due to symptoms I was feeling. Everything no lead by to anxiety. I was finally able to get my therapist approved. After seeing her I started to feel better.

",Can’t leave out heart palps.
How to stop worrying all the time?,I have always been a really bad worrier but over the last few years it has got so much worse. The smallest of things sets me off into a panic that I can't stop thinking about and can't get over then when I do eventually get over it something else comes and the cycle continues and when something big happens its like I can't even think of anything else and I start excessively cleaning and worrying and eating and I don't know how to stop worrying about it even if it is something that I can't control and then if I don't have anything present to worry about I start worrying about stuff that happened in the past so I'm almost always nervous. I know this is something that every adult has to deal with as my Dad says that it is just endless worrying until you die but how do I get a bit more of an I don't care attitude or try to get over stuff a bit so I can live for a little bit freely.,"Hello, it's about first of all not seeking reassurance how what you're worried about won't happen or how likely it is to happen. And second, accept how it might indeed happen. And always add how it's okay if it happens, no matter how terrible it would be. This way it gets less and less scary the longer you use this approach."
When did the medication start working for you and how did you notice? ,"Hello, I'm in a very discouraged mood at the moment. I've been taking Lexapro for 23 days now and still feel like crap. I had a decent week last week but the last few days are absolute hell. When did the medication start working for you and how did you feel when it finally did? ","Hello, for me with Effexor it was 3 months. It took raising the dose each month until then till it finally started working. Then it felt like a miracle. Almost all anxiety was gone overnight. 

To my knowledge most SSRIs and SNRIs take between 4-8 weeks to start working. But you can never know. It varies heavilly from person to person. Either way you should notice when it starts helping even a little. I talked to several people and they all started noticing. So if you're not noticing anything, it's most likely not helping yet. But hang in there, it's so worth it."

Does anyone else feel a background ill feeling constantly?,"Hey everyone, I saw this was a community and thought I could ask something thats been quite puzzling and downright spooky. 

I've been feeling like I'm just constantly sick. I'm not sick like I feel great most of the time but I just can't seem to shake off the ""body fatigue"" or ""low iron weakness"" feeling you get when you're on the come up of getting sick. I've gotten multiple physical check ups which always come back clean. I truly don't know if this is a common thing or if I'm making any sense when I explain it but if someone does have any insight, please share.

Thanks for hearing me out! :)","This is a pretty common experience for someone dealing with heightened anxiety unfortunately. Many of the physical elements of fight or flight feel a lot like the flu. In my own experience and reading through this subreddit it’s pretty common to experience nausea, trembling/chills, general sense of dread, fatigue, hot flashes/sweats. Which of course doesn’t help when anxiety lies to us and tells us “what if” I’m actually sick, “what if” something is wrong with my stomach or heart or something. The physical symptoms and anxious thinking can become a vicious cycle. But knowing other people experience similar things because of their anxiety helps me to know it for what it is for sure"

Seeking employment with agoraphobia ,"I got a job when i was healthy, i was able to function, going in to work attending socials with colleagues and friends.

I feel lots of guilt, shame and anger towards parts of myself and I don't know if I should work on myself while living off of savings and staying at my parents or ""tough"" it out at a new employer with my anxiety.

Proper medication and constantly increasing exposure to situations that trigger agoraphobic response should do the trick, but it'll take some time, most likely a few months.

Meanwhile, I'd suggest taking offers for hard and dirty jobs that involve little to no communication with clients. Construction, trash picking, seasonal farm work."

Scared I have ALS,"10 weeks ago now the flu went through our house and since then I haven't felt the same. It was day 3 of having the flu I all of a sudden got the hot and cold sweats and felt like I was going to pass out. My lower legs felt really cold and tight. Since then my lower legs have felt really tight and within the last month they have started twitching all day everyday, I notice it especially when on the couch or in bed. I have also been getting random twitches in my upper legs, butt, back, arms, neck, under eyelid, lips and now my tongue (unsure if it's tingling or twitching). I also get these random buzzing feelings in my legs. All my blood vessels in my body are also very noticeable and ache quite often?

Since then I have noticed my left quad looks thinner just above the knee and the side of my left foot aches/hurts. My left arm/wrist also feels thinner but I don't feel any weakness as such but these twitches are scaring the hell out of me and I'm now fearing I have ALS.

I am a 28 year old female.

I have had a heap of blood tests which all came back normal and brain and spine MRI which came back normal.

Would you get all these symptoms at once and so quickly? If someone could please shed some light that would be great as I'm sending myself into such a state and barely sleeping.","Hello, the symptoms you described all sound like physical symptoms caused by anxiety. I used to have symptoms like that. 

And I don't know too much about ALS, but doesn't it affect only one part or area of the body instead being all over the place at the beginning? LIke only legs for example?"

Since then my lower legs have felt really tight and within the last month they have started twitching all day everyday, I notice it especially when on the couch or in bed. I have also been getting random twitches in my upper legs, butt, back, arms, neck, under eyelid, lips and now my tongue (unsure if it's tingling or twitching). I also get these random buzzing feelings in my legs. All my blood vessels in my body are also very noticeable and ache quite often?

Since then I have noticed my left quad looks thinner just above the knee and the side of my left foot aches/hurts. My left arm/wrist also feels thinner but I don't feel any weakness as such but these twitches are scaring the hell out of me and I'm now fearing I have ALS.

I am a 28 year old female.

I have had a heap of blood tests which all came back normal and brain and spine MRI which came back normal.

Would you get all these symptoms at once and so quickly? If someone could please shed some light that would be great as I'm sending myself into such a state and barely sleeping.",ALS presents with slow loss of control and weakness of limbs starting in the toes and fingers and moving up. It’s usually very insidious.
Stressed in your sleep?,"Is anyone else so anxious they feel it whilst they’re sleeping too? Like obviously you aren’t conscious, but for me I know I’ve been stressed all night because I’ll wake up with marks on my palms from where my fingernails have dug in, or jaw pain from clenching, or I’ll have nightmares, or I’ll just wake up too early and feel nauseous/anxious. 

I basically get no rest these days and its annoying, because as a result I feel anxious all the time during the day too. 

If anyone else has any tips to calm down before bed that would be appreciated. I do breathing exercises but it doesn’t help much. I usually rely on sheer exhaustion to put me to sleep. 

","I wake up usually at the same time everyday feeling anxious or an impending doom feeling and it takes a good hour to sleep again. I also know i had a anxious night if i wake up and my the inside of my cheeks are chewed from me grinding my teeth. Ive been super stressed lately but when i wasnt this stressed what helped was having a bedtime routine so my body was expecting to be calm and tired at the same time everyday. When ive had a really rough day i watch this guy on YouTube play geography games and doze off. Sometimes a warm drink helps too, i drink hot chocolate, it makes my body warm and tired lol 

Sleeping with anxiety feels like an extreme sport but i hope you can ease it soon☺️"

","I’m working on the root of the problem as well but I second a night guard. I’ve just had my 3rd tooth fixed because I grind so bad (forward and backwards-more rare). I’ve chewed through about 3 in a few months and needed to get a specialized one but it’ll be a lot cheaper than the fixed teeth. 
I used to do YouTube yoga before bed and even 5-10 helped me. I need to get back to that."

","Depends on how bad you feel but you can take a sleep liquid once in a while. It will knock you out.

Best to get a mouth guard, i grind my teeth in my sleep. 

Add white noise to your room as well. Breathing exercises and white noise is a great combo.

My Breathing exercise of choice is the 5 second square method. No idea the real name. Breathe in for 5 seconds, hold for 5, breathe out for a count of 5 and hold for 5. Repeat as needed.

If thoughts still creep in then I start to imagine writing the numbers as I count. Counting and imagining numbers should block all thoughts for a bit."

","I've dealt with problems sleeping due to my anxiety for years, teeth grinding, waking up in the middle of the night sweating my ass off, just generally a horrible time and the only thing that's seemed to help is sleeping medication. I personally take this med called Hydroxyzine that helps with both inducing sleep and lowering anxiety and its relatively helpful, sometimes over-the-counter sleeping meds work but usually they just knock you out, not lower the stress"

","Start with recognizing what causes your anxiety. Remind yourself that you’re working yourself up more than the situation(s) would cause. Once you find out the root cause of the anxiety, go to a professional and talk to them.

They could recommend some medication or even some doctors that would help. Trust me, you are NOT alone. Best of luck and update me if necessary."

","I’ve used CBD oils with concentrations ranging from 10% to 30% from the brand Eusphera during moments of anxiety or stress. They’ve helped me feel more relaxed and calm without causing drowsiness or making me feel sluggish. What I find most valuable is that, being natural, they are gentle on the body and the digestive system, which makes them easy to use as part of my routine. I don’t see a psychologist because my anxiety isn’t severe, but after discussing it with my doctor, I was advised to try this kind of product."

","So sorry to hear you’ve been through such significant trauma and what you are still going through as a result. 

I am so am sorry the things you have tried haven’t worked. Have you tried magnesium glycinate or epsom salt baths? I have just started using magnesium glycinate but also started recently on medication ( SSRI) so it might be just that working but I feel the magnesium is helping. I am no longer waking up with the claw marks and my body is not as tense . I am still waking up overnight and in the morning with panic attacks but their severity and the amount has definitely reduced a lot since using the magnesium glycinate as well, I just started last week. 

I started EMDT today to address the trauma. I also do guided meditation at least twice a day and listen to mediations to go to sleep. I know they take time to work but they are  meant to be helpful to reduce trauma response. I wish I knew the answer but this is what I have been trying . 

I hope you can feel safe and feel a blissful nights sleep soon."

Urgent help please :( Diarrhea issue ,"Hello all,
I woke up today morning with horrible diarrhea. Pure liquid. Anytime I drink water to keep myself hydrated, I just “piss” it out my rectum. Lower part of my stomach feels uncomfortable, not much of a pain but just sensitive if that makes sense.

Anyways, I was diagnosed with E.Coli about 2 weeks ago and finished taking my meds 7 days ago. I assume it was gone since my symptoms lessened but now idk. 

If anyone has gone through this? What can I do? I took 2 pills of Imodium earlier to see if it helps and drank tea. I’m afraid to eat cause I fear it’ll make my stomach hurt and now I’m afraid to drink water since I just poop it back out.

Thanks for letting me rant ","I would seriously consider changing your job, I used to work in a high intensity workplace where I was stressed and anxious every shift and now I work somewhere where my boss and coworkers trust and respect me and it's a night and day difference. You deserve to work somewhere where you don't get bullied and made to throw up from stress, this ISN'T normal or acceptable! 

Also it's never a bad time to see a therapist or counsellor if you have the ability to do so. Your mental health is ALWAYS more important than a job. If you can land a session with a counsellor AND get the hell out of this workplace I'd be surprised if your mood doesn't improve (not going to fix all your problems magically of course but it may be a good start?)"

Thanks for letting me rant ",Okay! Sorry - definitely not trying to promote any specific ideology - hence keeping ‘faith community’ non-specific. Just wanted to share what has been helpful for me in my journey.
"Vaping increased anxiety, I want to quit. ","TLDR: vaping increased my anxiety, didn’t realise until recently and want to quit. But don’t know how to cope with my anxiety without it. 

So I started vaping almost two years ago, quit. Then a bunch of things happened in my life and I started developing anxiety, then my boyfriend said why don’t you try vaping to release stress it works for me. Truthfully, I think without vaping and meds making it worse (probably just vapes I’m ngl) I’d be in a much better place but here I am, vape in hand and have now become a recluse in my house, that’s how bad my anxiety now is. I’m on sertraline, and of course, that increases your heart rate so as you may guess, I haven’t been in a good place. it’s been a year since everything started and now having done all my research and everything else, I know I have to quit. I just don’t know how, when, or anything else. I’m anxious about symptoms of withdrawal. I use about 2-3 vapes a single day. It’s a lot, but here I am. 

So guys, what the hell do I do? ","Sorry if this is blunt, but don't make my mistake of trying to mask anxiety and panic with Nicotine. When the gasket blows from that, my goodness it takes a Herculean effort to rectify. I'd recommend you come off it ASAP. Nicotine is an immediate trigger for a panic attack for me.


If you surf the quit vaping subs, you'll see just how many panic and anxiety sufferers there are that have had these issues stemming from heavy vaping. Those vapes deliver stupendous amounts of nic into your system compared to a fag. From a cancer standpoint they may be 'safer' but in many other ways they're simply awful for you. 


Consider quitting cold turkey and white knuckling through it. Conversely you can always choose to taper off the e-liquid but I always think this is a bit of a cop out and leads to kicking the can down the road. 


Regardless, please please ditch nicotine before it drags you deeper into an anxiety disorder, because it will. It in no way calms you (or anyone) down at all, fact."
Debating whether to ask my psychiatrist to switch me from Xanax to Klonopin - experiences with both?,"
At the outset, I want to note that I first tried to ask this question on the BP sub and received mostly sermons about the dangers of benzo addiction and testimonials from people who have struggled with it. If you’re seeing this and have navigated an addiction to benzos, that’s truly commendable, I’ve had friends go through it and know it’s a bitch. That said, I have maintained sobriety from alcohol for three years, and I fully recognize the importance of exercising caution with benzo use. I have a diagnosed panic disorder, and my treatment team—psychiatrist, therapist, and sponsor are all aware that I utilize a low dose (0.5 mg x 3 as needed) of Xanax. I do not misuse it. I’m not going to misuse it. I take it when it is absolutely necessary. 

Alright. So I’m debating whether to ask my psych to switch from Xanax to Klonopin, because I usually have to take 0.5 mg 2 or 3 times on a “panic” day, and at least in theory, it seems like one-dose of a pill with a longer duration and more gradual effect might be better suited for me. My questions are straightforward: 

1) For those who have experience with both Xanax and Klonopin, what differences have you observed between the two medications?

2) Is it possible to take Klonopin, even at the lowest dose or half of the lowest dose, during the daytime without experiencing significant sedation that would hinder my performance at work?

Those are the questions I am seeking feedback on. Nothing else. Thank you for your insights. 
","Xanax did very little for me. But klonopin was a life saver. When I started having panic attacks, my dr tried Xanax but it didn’t provide much relief. So she switched to klonopin and it immediately made me feel better. 

I’ve used it everyday for over a decade. I’m on a very low dose, .25mg a day. At my peak it was like 5mg a day. I adjusted and it didn’t make me particularly drowsy once I got used to it"

","You’ll build tolerance to the sedation regardless of the benzo, I am on 3mg Xanax a day for panic disorder and PTSD and it works wonders for years now. I don’t feel tired or impaired just calmer when I take 1mg.

My aunt has been on Klonopin for 35 years at 1mg a day for GAD with occasional panic attacks and has not had any issues with it. It works great for her but her anxiety disorder is not nearly as bad as mine is. Xanax has rebound anxiety and only lasts 4 hours and Klonopin lasts most of the day without the up and downs but isn’t as fast hitting for severe panic attacks. I’d try it maybe it would work for you!"

","Klonopin user of 12 years or more.  Been taking the same dose at the same time since the beginning.  I'll throw down an additional one on a really bad day, but it doesn't have any effect I would call ""sedating""  Obviously you're not going to drink alcohol while on it.  Try to start it when you have a day or two off so you can see how your body receives it.  Best of luck.  It's been reliable, cheap, and effective for me."

I had severe health anxiety until the day I received my c-word diagnosis

I know this may seem like a weird way to offer some encouragement, but I feel like my story is worth sharing. 

I have always had severe health anxiety. When I say severe, I mean SEVERE. Getting simple bloodwork would spiral me into a state of awful anxiety. I would not sleep or eat for days and would basically sit around googling symptoms and convincing myself I had every disease under the sun. If my results were even slightly high or low I would make myself sick with worry. If my scans came back clear I would be convinced they missed something big. Ive been 100% sure I’ve had just about every disease under the sun at one point or another. And of course the c-word was my biggest fear or all. It got to the point where I just avoided going to the doctor because I couldn’t handle the anxiety. Every ache, tinge, bump (you name it) would like to a worst case scenario self diagnosis. 

Fast forward to a few months ago when I started having some odd symptoms that landed me in the doctor. I had various tests done, didn’t eat or sleep for weeks while waiting on results and for the first time in my life the worst case scenario came to fruition. About a month ago I got the call from my doc telling me I had the big C. 

Here’s where things took the most unexpected turn of my life. At first I thought I was just in shock because I didn’t feel anything at all. Just kind or numb you know? In the weeks following all of my anxiety started to shed. The big thing I freaked myself about for years was happening and I was handling it like a CHAMP. I was sleeping, eating, laughing with family and friends and going to my appointments with optimism. 

The moral of the story is…you are SO much stronger than you realize. Believe me. The chances of anyone getting a big diagnosis is low and VERY unlikely to begin with. But if the worst does happen, you are going to shock yourself with how your strength rises to the occasion. 

Please don’t live your life in fear. You are full of health and vitality. Believe it. 

Life is a beautiful gift and should be lived to the fullest everyday. The day I received my diagnosis was the day I finally made the decision to start living. 

I believe 99.9% of you reading this will never have to receive that diagnosis. So do me a favor and make that choice for yourself today ❤️",& you will continue to handle it like a champ! Praying for healing and for health <3

I still have major health anxiety if any blood test result is even slightly high. Doctor has to always reassure me that’s it’s nothing to worry about out. Then it starts all over again. I have general anxiety but health anxiety makes me feel dizzy and I always think I have cancer again or some degenerative disease . I remember when I first found out I had cancer . I felt the same as you . I was not really worried I just felt like I needed to get through it . I have to stop this anxiety it’s ruining my life"

I had severe health anxiety until the day I received my c-word diagnosis

I know this may seem like a weird way to offer some encouragement, but I feel like my story is worth sharing. 

I have always had severe health anxiety. When I say severe, I mean SEVERE. Getting simple bloodwork would spiral me into a state of awful anxiety. I would not sleep or eat for days and would basically sit around googling symptoms and convincing myself I had every disease under the sun. If my results were even slightly high or low I would make myself sick with worry. If my scans came back clear I would be convinced they missed something big. Ive been 100% sure I’ve had just about every disease under the sun at one point or another. And of course the c-word was my biggest fear or all. It got to the point where I just avoided going to the doctor because I couldn’t handle the anxiety. Every ache, tinge, bump (you name it) would like to a worst case scenario self diagnosis. 

Fast forward to a few months ago when I started having some odd symptoms that landed me in the doctor. I had various tests done, didn’t eat or sleep for weeks while waiting on results and for the first time in my life the worst case scenario came to fruition. About a month ago I got the call from my doc telling me I had the big C. 

Here’s where things took the most unexpected turn of my life. At first I thought I was just in shock because I didn’t feel anything at all. Just kind or numb you know? In the weeks following all of my anxiety started to shed. The big thing I freaked myself about for years was happening and I was handling it like a CHAMP. I was sleeping, eating, laughing with family and friends and going to my appointments with optimism. 

The moral of the story is…you are SO much stronger than you realize. Believe me. The chances of anyone getting a big diagnosis is low and VERY unlikely to begin with. But if the worst does happen, you are going to shock yourself with how your strength rises to the occasion. 

Please don’t live your life in fear. You are full of health and vitality. Believe it.

Health anxiety is common (especially nowadays with “disease” being presented to us constantly on social media and television). Making the choice to live in the present moment and not in the future is so important!

I have always had severe health anxiety. When I say severe, I mean SEVERE. Getting simple bloodwork would spiral me into a state of awful anxiety. I would not sleep or eat for days and would basically sit around googling symptoms and convincing myself I had every disease under the sun. If my results were even slightly high or low I would make myself sick with worry. If my scans came back clear I would be convinced they missed something big. Ive been 100% sure I’ve had just about every disease under the sun at one point or another. And of course the c-word was my biggest fear or all. It got to the point where I just avoided going to the doctor because I couldn’t handle the anxiety. Every ache, tinge, bump (you name it) would like to a worst case scenario self diagnosis. 

Fast forward to a few months ago when I started having some odd symptoms that landed me in the doctor. I had various tests done, didn’t eat or sleep for weeks while waiting on results and for the first time in my life the worst case scenario came to fruition. About a month ago I got the call from my doc telling me I had the big C. 

Here’s where things took the most unexpected turn of my life. At first I thought I was just in shock because I didn’t feel anything at all. Just kind or numb you know? In the weeks following all of my anxiety started to shed. The big thing I freaked myself about for years was happening and I was handling it like a CHAMP. I was sleeping, eating, laughing with family and friends and going to my appointments with optimism. 

The moral of the story is…you are SO much stronger than you realize. Believe me. The chances of anyone getting a big diagnosis is low and VERY unlikely to begin with. But if the worst does happen, you are going to shock yourself with how your strength rises to the occasion. 

Please don’t live your life in fear. You are full of health and vitality. Believe it. 

Life is a beautiful gift and should be lived to the fullest everyday. The day I received my diagnosis was the day I finally made the decision to start living. 

I believe 99.9% of you reading this will never have to receive that diagnosis. So do me a favor and make that choice for yourself today ❤️",It ruined my life so many years too. As long as you’re getting your regular checkups then I don’t think you have anything to worry about. Tell yourself every single day “I am healthy” “I am healed” “I am full of vitality” “my cells are healthy and thriving” … eventually your brain will start to believe it. Rebuke the lies and replace them with healing affirmations.

I also think I’m having a hard time juggling the gratitude for a second chance at life and the newfound understanding of how fragile life is. Only way to make it I think is to move through it. Best of to you!

Going through all of the health anxiety led to me a passion in non-toxic and organic living. I’m now in the process of opening an organic storefront…and to think…I would never be here if it wasn’t for my anxiety issues 😅find gratitude in everything 🙏

It got to the point where I just avoided going to the doctor because I couldn’t handle the anxiety. Every ache, tinge, bump (you name it) would like to a worst case scenario self diagnosis. 

Fast forward to a few months ago when I started having some odd symptoms that landed me in the doctor. I had various tests done, didn’t eat or sleep for weeks while waiting on results and for the first time in my life the worst case scenario came to fruition. About a month ago I got the call from my doc telling me I had the big C. 

Here’s where things took the most unexpected turn of my life. At first I thought I was just in shock because I didn’t feel anything at all. Just kind or numb you know? In the weeks following all of my anxiety started to shed. The big thing I freaked myself about for years was happening and I was handling it like a CHAMP. I was sleeping, eating, laughing with family and friends and going to my appointments with optimism. 

The moral of the story is…you are SO much stronger than you realize. Believe me. The chances of anyone getting a big diagnosis is low and VERY unlikely to begin with. But if the worst does happen, you are going to shock yourself with how your strength rises to the occasion. 

Please don’t live your life in fear. You are full of health and vitality. Believe it. 

Life is a beautiful gift and should be lived to the fullest everyday. The day I received my diagnosis was the day I finally made the decision to start living. 

I believe 99.9% of you reading this will never have to receive that diagnosis. So do me a favor and make that choice for yourself today ❤️","I hate those stats because they don’t show the whole picture. Average age of diagnosis is 66-80 years old. Many are caught in preventative screening and have an excellent prognosis. There are so many stats you can read to prove your chances of getting cancer in your 20s, 30s and 40s is very rare."

I had severe health anxiety until the day I received my c-word diagnosis

I know this may seem like a weird way to offer some encouragement, but I feel like my story is worth sharing. 

I have always had severe health anxiety. When I say severe, I mean SEVERE. Getting simple bloodwork would spiral me into a state of awful anxiety. I would not sleep or eat for days and would basically sit around googling symptoms and convincing myself I had every disease under the sun. If my results were even slightly high or low I would make myself sick with worry. If my scans came back clear I would be convinced they missed something big. Ive been 100% sure I’ve had just about every disease under the sun at one point or another. And of course the c-word was my biggest fear or all.

Finally handling health anxiety,"Hey yall!! I just needed a place to vent and share my story a bit and the progress I’ve been making, as I don’t have many people I can really share this with!

6 months ago I made a total 180 with my life. I moved across the country, got engaged, and started a new more draining job. I started working immediately after the big move, as I’ve always handled change in stride, but I guess this time around my body didn’t catch up quite as fast as my mind did. I ended up collapsing at work, legs non functional, brain having a weird feeling all over it, and had to go to the hospital right in the middle of my very first shift.

I was told it was a panic attack, something I’d never had before. I hadn’t experienced any anxiety over anything but pretty typical things up until this point, although I had a small overdone fear of death due to being raised by a drug addict and a paranoid, doctor hating man who had his own issues too. This made me very, very against ever receiving medical help prior. I went to the ER three more times that week, begged for an MRI and bloodwork, and everything just came back normal again and again. I couldn’t believe a panic attack could make someone feel the way I physically felt. 

This began a 6 month long spiral into my personal living hell. I had felt closer to death than ever before in that ER, with this constant ‘weird feeling’ in my brain in the back of my head especially, like something was misfiring. I kept hyperfixating on how I thought my brain would just snap or disconnect, like I’d start seizing any moment, but I never did. Thus, my health anxiety began to grow. I just couldn’t accept that I had randomly developed anxiety out of the blue and it could affect me quite so strongly. 

The reality of this situation was that I had undiagnosed OCD, and this was my new hyperfixation. I had fixated on many things before, but this one brought great great great damage to me. Over the last six months I’ve stopped being able to function almost entirely. I can’t enjoy car drives anymore, what if I crash? I can’t enjoy video games anymore, my brain might had a tumour. I can’t get routine blood work done, what if I have the big C? Every tingle, every touch, every little jolt, every typo, every time my ankle rolled, every time I missed my arm into my coat sleeve; is this a tumour? Is this an aneurysm? Am I losing my cognitive function? Why can’t I focus? Why am I so scared? I never feared these things before? What is my body trying to tell me? If I ignore this as a panic attack will I die and regret not getting help? All the same thoughts typical to health anxiety. 

Today, I started Lexapro. I got a full set of bloodwork done after talking to my doctor, finally. She thinks I could have hypothyroidism, I think I could be dying. The bloodwork, though, is probably going to come back with something that won’t kill me, if anything at all. All day I’ve been reading stories of how life changing this medicine can be, reading stories of peoples lives changing. I’m worried, I’m anxious, still, that it won’t work for me. That I never had anxiety to begin with, this is all so freaking foreign and new to me, but the reality is that in 6 months nothing has happened to me and every result is clear. And it’s time to accept that I am healthy. Sort of. But that doesn’t mean I don’t need help. 

If this medication doesn’t work, I’ll move onto the next. I’m dedicated to keep trying until I find something that’s going to work for me, until I stop having to fear every twinge and every misaction and ever abnormal thought, and so that I can live again, and enjoy the things I used to enjoy to their fullest. I’m tired of stressing out and exhausting those around me, my fiance, my family and friends, and I’m ready to take control again and do what needs to be done to stop feeling this way. 

I’m scared of my blood results coming back. I’m scared of side effects from this medicine sending me into a spiral. I’m scared of ignoring these ‘symptoms’ that the medication may give me and missing something important. I’m scared of having to try other meds if this one doesn’t work. I’m scared this one WILL work and I’ll be stuck on it. I’m scared. So scared. But it’s day one of this medicine, and after months of the gnawing I’m finally ready to do what needs to be done, and I’m so proud of myself for doing it. I will tough out any side effects. I will listen to my body. And I will trust that I’m ok, and young, and healthy, and I can be happy again, and I’ll let the doctor who trained her whole life for this show me how. 

Compassion is so important to show to yourself and to others. I hope this helps me and I hope I can start to feel better, and if I don’t I hope I find something else that will. Above all else, I am hopeful, optimistic, and proud of myself for the first time in a long time. I can’t wait to feel better. ","Health anxiety is the absolute worst, I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. We already feel like everything is going to kill us, and anxiety makes your body do crazy, unexplainable things that just feed the fire. A few days ago I was in the ER with weird symptoms, felt like I was going to meet death, panicked out of my mind. They couldn’t find anything other than the effects of extreme stress and anxiety. The rational part of me knew that all along, but it’s like my mind needed to hear it from a doctor. I’m happy you’re taking steps to beat it, you seem to have a great attitude about things so you’ll likely come out on top."
Finally handling health anxiety,"Hey yall!! I just needed a place to vent and share my story a bit and the progress I’ve been making, as I don’t have many people I can really share this with!

6 months ago I made a total 180 with my life. I moved across the country, got engaged, and started a new more draining job. I started working immediately after the big move, as I’ve always handled change in stride, but I guess this time around my body didn’t catch up quite as fast as my mind did. I ended up collapsing at work, legs non functional, brain having a weird feeling all over it, and had to go to the hospital right in the middle of my very first shift.

I was told it was a panic attack, something I’d never had before. I hadn’t experienced any anxiety over anything but pretty typical things up until this point, although I had a small overdone fear of death due to being raised by a drug addict and a paranoid, doctor hating man who had his own issues too. This made me very, very against ever receiving medical help prior. I went to the ER three more times that week, begged for an MRI and bloodwork, and everything just came back normal again and again. I couldn’t believe a panic attack could make someone feel the way I physically felt.

The way it effects different parts of your body will run you crazy. I went to the ER 3x in one week. I live in a big city so I went to a different one each time. I felt kinda embarrassed. All for them to tell me nothing was there and I was fine. They gave me hydroxyzine. But that didn’t do anything but give me heart palpitations and send me into another spiral. The more holistic route may be for me. Pills scare me too because I don’t want any side effects.

I'm going through the same thing. Every little sensationbin my body means I'm dying. It started with worry about my heart but has now moved to other areas like mybhead and digestive sustem too. I know how debilitating it is. I started Lexapro 23 days ago to try and find relief so I can live my life again. I'm still balancing out, having a lot of bad days but I also had some really good days too. Just have to give it time. I hope the med works well for us both. I wish you a healthy life."
Has anxiety ever given you random episodes of feeling faint?,"I'd like some reassurance, by hearing if you guys also have experienced this, because my anxiety makes me also worry about my health a lot.

Do you sometimes, when not anxious at the moment, start feeling like you're dissociating, numb and that you're going to faint without warning? 

My ears also start popping and my heart doesn't usually palpitate (it has before if I spiral into panicking and thinking I'm dying) but I can feel it beating harder.

Thanks, I hope you all have a peaceful day, I'm sending much love! 

",Yes. I get it pretty often and hot flashes with it. Sometimes I also get a little bit nauseous.

","I've thought i was having a heart attack before... my vision was going black from the edges in... after about 10 minutes I couldn't see it all. Dizzy, wobbly, dripping sweat, shaking..... definitely felt like I might pass out.

I was in the car as a passenger at the time. I had my wife drive me to the ER.

Got the ER. I told them, ""I'm either having a heart attack or a panic attack.""

Got my ER bracelet. Sat there for 10 minutes. Insane panic attack finally comes down from it's peak.

I told the front desk of the ER, ""......and it was a panic attack.""

Left the ER after. Anxiety can make your body go completely nuts.

Im.not really sure where the limits are as far as what anxiety can do to your body. A lot."

","Typically, I would have these symptoms during anxiety. If they are happening at other times, that sounds off. 

Of course, anxiety can build up at any time, and you do not realize you are having a panic attack until you look at your hands and they are shaking like crazy.

When you feel off, check to see if your hands are steady."

","This is me, ever. single. day. And it started with nursing school in 2016, I wasn’t on meds because I didn’t know I had anxiety. Phobic of needles, and I quit nursing school. Fast forward to 2022, it started again. Walking down the halls of the nursing home I worked at, I’d feel funny. Now, I can’t go into the super Walmart (I stick with delivery or the neighborhood Walmart). Social anxiety! Today for Thanksgiving I went to my dad’s and we ate, talked, it was fine. All a sudden I felt dissociated. Then hot, then lightheaded. This doesn’t happen when I’m alone. So I stay alone. Crying as I type this.. I was on lexapro but it made my mind feel foggier so I quit. I do take clonzapam twice daily PRN. It helps me hold down a job. I’m now a secretary at a hospital. It’s living hell. I’m comfortable to myself, I’m a mess physically around people. So I get it. It’s the hardest battle."

Anxiety due to Climate Change,"So, as the title suggests, I'm in quite a bit of anxiety lately.

I'm just 19 (born in 2005) in a somewhat developing part of the world (southern Brazil). I have experienced what massive flooding due to climate change is and how politicians here in general (both on the left and the right) generally use climate related issues as populism to gather votes first hand in May, as I nearly lost my house (water was just 50 cm from entering my house). Since then my anxiety due to climate change has skyrocketed.

I've seen the past Climate Action Tracker that show that ""the most likely scenario"" is a 2.7º C increase and what this means. I know what policies in the US holds in regards to fossil fuels (despite bipartisan lawmakers being quite fond of the IRA). I've read some articles such as those by Brian O'neill that claim the trends in poverty/hunger reduction and longevity increase will continue despite climate change (Nature Magazine ""Envisioning a Future With Climate Change"", 2023), and also Hannah Ritchie's articles regarding her recent book, but also how badly these were received by the scientific community. Who can I trust, then? Is everything going to be on a downward spiral of doom or is it going to be average?

I can't help but always have this feeling that it's useless having hope. I dream of having children, having dogs, being the one who will retire my parents and traveling the world, but what if all of those efforts are all for nothing and our current society collapses in my lifetime (conflict due to resources, famine and poverty increasing significantly year on year)? Heck, how can people say my generation will live over a 100 years?

I tend to spend my time when I'm not at work or college to search things on Google to give me hope, but everything points that I will either live in a dystopia or not even make it past 40. There are somedays that I can't simply pay attention at anything because my brain is on a downward spiral.

So, what I'm trying to say is: can someone who works in fields that are related to the climate change issue (energy, agriculture and infrastructure specially) say something that calms me down? Is it really that bad as it seems? I just don't want to see civilization collapse during my lifetime. I want to have reasons to believe I will get to meet my grandchildren, be 90 years old, this type of thing, that says to me that it isn't a lost cause and I have a future to look towards to.","Hi,   
I'm about 15 years older than you but I went through EXTREME climate anxiety many years ago to the point where I was entirely hopeless and considering ending things. Climate change is indeed terrifying and I don't work in the field so I can't give you hard data or anything but I can tell you some things that help me now several years later; 

STOP reading articles looking for hard answers. This is reassurance seeking that will only make anxiety worse because even though we have data and projections we do not have ANSWERS. There will never be any article that says ""hey you you're going to live to be 90 don't sweat it"" because we simply do not know. And the hard truth is you are going to have to live with that uncertainty and try to make a life for yourself DESPITE not knowing. Its the only way. Remember projections and forecasting is good for planning and taking action but it is not a crystal ball and as you point out reports are conflicting anyway.

Live your life IN SPITE of the fear. I am considering starting a family soon myself and the future feels so grim sometimes I wonder why bother but honestly we HAVE to live for today. I look at all the things that scare me about the future (war, flooding, earthquakes, pandemics) and I decide to live my life IN SPITE of these fears. Tell these fears to go fuck themselves, you're young and you're going to live your life! Suck it climate change! Obviously I'm not suggesting you become a nihilist or a hedonist but when those fears cloud your brain telling yourself you're going to  be brave and live life despite them has helped me immensely. 

And further to that, I'll admit I don't know a lot about Brazil but there must be a LOT of like minded young adults taking action. Are there environmental groups you can join? Protests you can be a part of? If you feel safe to do so of course but linking up with like minded people who are taking action (and not just doom mongering) helped me so much and it may help you too. Finding people who feel the same way you do and who are being proactive will help give you a sense of power and purpose. 

I hope you're able to keep safe and I'm sorry your home is at risk that is a type of anxiety that is outside my purview but I wish you the best and hope you stay safe. Best of luck DM if you'd like!"

My family has lots of cases of suicide and despite going to therapy and having medication since 9 years old, I have these roller coaster moments that I'm fantastic then I'm terrible. This is one of those cycles.

I think I misrepresented what I wanted to say in this (reassurance, yes, I'll admit to such). But having projections and data shown to me do calm me down, especially if it's peer reviewed (I'm publishing an article on AI in some months at my university's magazine, I sure as hell want people to say to me what is wrong so I can improve). One that calmed me down in a bit is a projection by the FAO that crop yield per acre rises in a business as usual scenario up until 2050 (their maximum range in projections) while harvested area and hunger rates basically flatline.

As for protesting, not that big of a fan but mostly due to some personal disagreements with a few political groups being too extreme in my country. Not going to sugarcoat anything on either side of politics. I've seen what some right-wing lunatic such as Bolsonaro can do but also how much harm a left-wing populist, someone like Lula can also so. And basically, politics here has turned into a cult of their personalities. You can't have a civilised discussion about politics without it turning into a ""but what about (oposite side) actions"". I don't like extremism and most enviromentalists that are famous here fall into these categories, with few exceptions"

I'm glad articles are reassuring! You seem like a scientifically minded person and I'm glad data provides relief but I would still caution that even peer reviewed articles aren't gateways to the future and we don't know what will happen in spite of our best guesses and projections. But you probably already know that ;) 

Do you have other methods that help calm you down that aren't reading data? Spending your free time Googling for answers is only going to increase your anxiety and doom feelings, it is reassurance seeking (believe me I do it too!) Going for a walk, seeing friends, art, reading, movies etc? I'd encourage you to lean in things in your daily life that give you some relief and joy and maybe talk to a health care provider about new coping techniques for your low spells.

 One thing my therapist challenged me to do was making a futures goals list in Excel, just write out everything I want to do (travel, graduate school, family etc) and a timeline of what steps I need to take to accomplish it. Make your plans to travel, live to be 90, get a sweet dog, write it down. You don't know if it'll happen we could all get blown to bits by aliens tomorrow for all we know but at least it may help shift your thinking towards living instead of stewing in your own anxiety juice."

If you know what a gaúcho person is, you know I can't spend a day without mate and a weekend without a barbecue and I do enjoy that. But after this entertainment ends or even during it, this anxiety comes to haunt me and I again go on a downwards spiral. I know forecasts or projections even in peer reviewed literature are not guarantees of the future. I'm quite aware of that but it is the only thing that is shown to be calming to me hahahaha.

My desire to conquer my own part of the world, making plans for the future tend to be a double edged sword since I am quite science oriented. Like: I know how to accomplish this in an easier way, but I know that there could not be a future to look forward to.

But on a more positive note, I do have a desire to make myself some good cash, investing, before taking some masters, a PhD and then becoming a professor. I'm quite a bit of a workaholic. I am a dual citizen (Brazilian and Luxembourgish. My first language is actually a German dialect, not Portuguese. Only learned it at about 5 years old) and want to take my masters in Data Science, Networks, Cybersecurity or/and AI in the EU since I can't be deported there. Professors do make good money where I live, but being in the private sector especially when earning foreign currency such as USD and EUR and spending in a weak currency such as the Real does give me way better quality of life."

I guess my suggestion would be when you're feeling the doom feelings try and experiment with not looking up data. Just sit with the doom. If I had to guess you're doing something similar to what I used to do which is trying to get a hit of reassurance for your doom feelings, get that reassurance from articles and data, get relief temporarily and the cycle continues. The CBT model that helped me basically challenges you to cut out the reassurance behavior and force you to sit with that uncertainty and anxiety, get used to it, and then watch as it lessens over time. You've been in therapy before so maybe you're familiar with this already but that is what as helped me most."
Anxiety after weed !!,"Hi almost a year ago smoked weed with a friend (I’m not a weed smoker , prior to that I only smoked weed once and it was cool) , it got me really high that I got anxiety and trouble breathing while high even remember i had to leave the home and walk for around half an hour 
Things got better that night and was able to sleep 
But the anxiety seems to have never left , 
I started getting chest pain troubles breathing , heart palpitations , sweating , getting sick like cold flu frequently sometimes that would only last an evening 
Checked every possible doctor and all said i was cleared , then saw a neurologist which put me on some anti depressants , took em for a month , didn’t really help , i saw another neurologist that prescribed me some anti anxiety pills for a month , they did help , felt not completely well but much better for that month , started feeling like myself again , but once treatment was over , started getting the same symptoms again .. 
idk what to do and will it ever pass , has anyone ever experienced a similar thing ?

idk what to do and will it ever pass , has anyone ever experienced a similar thing ? ","Thanks for the reply🙌 , what are the chances to ever get over this trauma ? with the help of anxiety meds ofc"
Anxiety after weed !!,"Hi almost a year ago smoked weed with a friend (I’m not a weed smoker , prior to that I only smoked weed once and it was cool) , it got me really high that I got anxiety and trouble breathing while high even remember i had to leave the home and walk for around half an hour 
Things got better that night and was able to sleep 
But the anxiety seems to have never left ,

How do you convince yourself that it's just anxiety?,"Hello, I'm having soms pretty weird symptoms. I'm anxious 24/7 and I feel heart palpitations, lightheadedness, weak legs, tired, jittery all day long, internal restlessness and unsteady feeling when walking. My brain really thinks there is something wrong with me and I'm dying from a disease. All testing came back normal, from heart mri, CT, bloodwork to test at the neurologist. All good. Yet I still cant seem to believe it as I'm still feeling all these symptoms. How do you convince yourself it's just anxiety? I'm really struggling.","You forcefully accept the facts in front of You and let time do its thing. When symptoms and heightened anxiety arise, You sit with them and let them through Your body. You relax Your body when You wish to tense it up the most and calm Your mind consciously by talking to Yourself mentally when You wish to freak out and panic. 

Recently I have suffered from lightheadedness and unsteadiness when walking as well. This was new to me, and freaked me the fuck out. Still, as symptoms go, it's a minor symptom and if it doesn't progress into inability to walk or whatever, I was not to worry. It didn't, and I didn't worry no more. It passed, then came back, then passed again.

You convince Yourself that it's just anxiety most easily by accepting the fact that none of Your symptoms are disruptive of Your day-to-day life, and therefore are minor symptoms. Serious illness WOULD BE VERY DISRUPTIVE TRUST ME. People who are unsure whether it's anxiety or something serious can always bank on anxiety. People who have a serious illness KNOW that it is a serious illness and not just anxiety."

Need someone to talk to,Just called 911 because I was having chest pains with tingles in my left hand. The paramedics showed up and offered to take me to the hospital but I declined after they did the ekg and tested my blood pressure. I answered all the questions. I'm feeling really weird right now. Like I'm having this consistent ache in my chest it comes and goes and sometimes stays for a bit. My back feels weird and I'm thinking my left arm is having tingles and I'm only 30. Do you guys ever have anxiety that lasts this long? I'm full blown convinced myself I'm having a heart attack or about to have one.,"This was me a few days ago, it’s sucked. Every symptom of a heart attack is also a symptom that can be caused by stress/anxiety. I had chest pains, left arm tingling and going numb, neck was stiff, shortness of breath, I was pretty convinced I was going to the upper room. Spent half the night in the ER, blood tests, ekg, X-rays, etc., all flawless. If your symptoms are causing panic, they’re likely exactly that. I know it doesn’t help you immediately but I had every symptom you have and nothing at all was wrong with me."

I'm full blown convinced myself I'm having a heart attack or about to have one.,"Anxiety is the fear of feeling fear and it causes trapped energy. 

Your body senses danger, even if there isn’t *real* danger (like being attacked by a bear)

It boils down to not trusting the self, not trusting your body, not believing that you are safe in your body. The other piece is fear of “not knowing”, and the big root of that is a need for control. 

This requires slow, steady work to rebuild the relationship with self. To trust you are in good health. To believe in yourself that you’ve experienced this feeling of panic before, that it will pass, and you will be okay. 

It’s easier said than done, but it can be done. Having control of everything is impossible. Instead, try to focus on what brings you happiness and joy, day to day.

Anytime I feel my body’s alarm going off, and there’s no real danger, I take a brisk 30 minute walk or I will calmly walk and shake my arms, hands, shoulders - this disperses the energy

As a last thought - check out the D.A.R.E. podcast. It is the reason I’m able to better manage my anxiety disorder, today 

Good luck and be kind to yourself"

Loss of libido and anxiety ,"I will try to keep this short

M [31] (Muslim, so I didn’t have sex before marriage) (super healthy and fit)


• I was married (to a 27 female) in February 2023(divorced in May 2024), wasn’t anxious about my sex drive at all, I felt pretty normal, maybe 6 months or so before the marriage, I felt that I don’t have the urge to masturbate that frequently (which I related to maybe being in a relationship with a girl that I’m getting married to).

- we were having tons of fights and arguments during the 6 months before marriage.

(Flash forward to marriage)

- we had sex the first day, everything was awesome, no problem at all, she enjoyed it and I made sure that she feels good and asking her what she likes.

(At the time, I felt a little bit weird, because still I felt like something was off, it’s like I’m acting being horny or smth)

- in the day right after marriage, she argued with me for hours about something really trivial, that I felt I wanted to runaway from the whole thing, it was a disastrous argument that went for hours.

- in the next days we had also some arguments that were always super weird, like me asking her to wake up so we can have breakfast together and spent the day (which she didn’t do during our whole marriage)

- in the next days we had sex maybe twice or once a day, I still felt weird, but as long as she is happy, that was enough for me. (But still I had a small concern that why I don’t feel horny?!)

- Day 10 of marriage (during our honeymoon), without any prior notice, she started yelling at me, talking in the most insensitive way, that I don’t have sex with her enough times, that I don’t ever initiate it, that this is not satisfactory for her in any way or form, all this while yelling and backlashing, and that her friends’ husbands made love to them a lot more, and that she isn’t experiencing that like them.

(I was devastated the way she talked to me, if she told me that in a nicer way, more gentle or calm way, I wouldn’t feel any kind of hurt or anything, I would simply comply and tell her that this is new to me also, and we need to communicate more)

- I told her maybe I should check my hormones or smth, and that we would fix that, but I never got over that fight, after two other months of fighting over small stupid things, I told her that I don’t want to have sex with her, and I don’t feel safe in this relationship, in which she didn’t try to make any effort to fix.

We finally got divorced, our marriage lasted for 16 months or so, and in the last 7 months or so, we didn’t have sex at all, I avoided all forms of physical intimacy in the last 7 months with her. 

I feel really great getting out of this relationship, everything is so good, except for the libido thing, since that awful confrontation, I lost all my confidence and connection with my sexuality, I’m super anxious all the time that something is wrong with me, I don’t feel horny at all, I don’t even remember how it feels to be horny, it’s really the only thing that I think of almost all the day, everyday!, I feel so bad that I might never feel that again!

I masturbate only to make sure that everything is working normally.

I used to be horny if I saw an attractive woman, now I see that she is attractive, but I almost feel nothing!

If I masturbate to po*n, I feel anxious that I’m not really horny, why I do this?, and these thoughts take me out of the moment, and makes me extra anxious.

I did hormonal tests and penial Doppler, and everything is normal!

I did take SSRI in 2020 for like 5 months, but my libido suffered in 2022 mainly!, as I have read about PSSD, and I freaked out!, I don’t know what’s wrong with me?!, I’m hesitant to approach any woman, even traumatized that I don’t know if my libido would be a problem, would the same thing happen again, what is even the point of approaching any girl, if I don’t have a sex drive!, I feel miserable!

Any tips or advice?

TL;DR: my libido is gone, and I’m super anxious all the time because of it, and I don’t know what to do!",Maybe you can find a sexaltherapist. They should be the righgt people to talk about this and should have the knowöedge to explain and perhaps can give you advice on what you can try in your private time.

Thanksgiving Anxiey,"Hosted Thanksgiving dinner at my house with another couple yesterday (family and old friends 1000 miles away).  I was a mess. Billy anxiety was awful. Felt like a bad host. Felt judged because my house isn’t as big as the other couple.  Dropped a casserole on the floor (thankfully son cleaned it up). Feel “less than”. Like I don’t measure up to our “friends”. Had wife criticize my “hostess” skills (serve the appetizers, put out plat s, turn the ceiling fans off, etc). Went to bed early and cried.  Now I need Xanax for the next 3-4 days just to function. ","Not going to lie, sounds like a shitty day.  Understand your need to feel shitty as a result. 

But, nobody else from today is worrying about it right now, I'd bet that nobody else will even think about it at all in a few days. 

So, deep breath, try to see perspective and try to focus on something else positive that is happening in your life.

Most of us need to choose our family, because the one we’re born into for whatever reason. My friend is basically my best friend, and we have laughs together. The fact that they showed up I hope is their way of saying “We’re here, we care, we love you.”"
Small win today,My anxiety has been super bad lately and I’ve been crying non stop. I had a panic attack this morning and was very worried about how I would get through thanksgiving without breaking down in front of my family. Well I made it a whole SIX hours without crying. There were moments where I felt very overwhelmed and wanted to hide in the bathroom to cry but I didn’t. It was very exhausting but I made it through thanksgiving. This is the longest I’ve gone without crying in the past week. ,You did a great job! Congratulations and happy thanksgiving 🧡

anxiety attack vs heart attack,"I've been having anxiety symptoms for months and have had several panic attacks where I've been checked with EKG and everything normal. Also saw a cardiologist a few months ago who said everything normal. He just quickly looked at my heart with an ultrasound though.

The past couple weeks I've had new symptoms; almost daily tingling in left arm, sometimes throat, sometimes nausea and pain around my heart area. I think the heart pain is muscle pain but not sure.

Today I am having an elevated anxiety attack for the last 6 hours. It comes and goes. Tingling in left arm, pressure/burning in chest, tingling an tightness n tongue and throat, disorientation fatigue. It seems different because when I do physical exercise it does not seem to help, and may actually make it worse.

I did swim 30 minutes intensely twice this week, and no cheat pain during. Did not seem to impact my symptoms on the days I did swim. I don't have them much waking up, they develop about 5 hours after waking up, peak middle of day and hang around rest of the day except when I'm very relaxed at night.

I checked my BP and pulse. Pulse is 80 resting and BP is 115/70. Usually I'm 125-130/80.

Seems strange to have lower blood pressure at increased pulse and adrenaline constricting my left arms veins.

So any thoughts on all this? I actually have my first psychiatrist appointment Monday, I had just about convinced myself that this is all anxiety and now I start to get this different kind of attack.",Hour are you doing today?
anxiety attack vs heart attack,"I've been having anxiety symptoms for months and have had several panic attacks where I've been checked with EKG and everything normal. Also saw a cardiologist a few months ago who said everything normal. He just quickly looked at my heart with an ultrasound though.

The past couple weeks I've had new symptoms; almost daily tingling in left arm, sometimes throat, sometimes nausea and pain around my heart area. I think the heart pain is muscle pain but not sure.

Today I am having an elevated anxiety attack for the last 6 hours. It comes and goes. Tingling in left arm, pressure/burning in chest, tingling an tightness n tongue and throat, disorientation fatigue. It seems different because when I do physical exercise it does not seem to help, and may actually make it worse.

I went out for a long walk and eventually the exercise made me feel better so I realized it was just an anxiety issue."
My 22M girlfriend 21F listed her reasons for the breakup. Did I mess up? ,"Obviously this wasn’t done every single time, but the phone checking. I really didn’t like that and felt it was an invasion of my personal space and the trying to log into my snap on your phone. You denied it at first until I had to show u a legitimate email I got from your phone trying to log in. 
It also made me feel uncomfortable to leave my phone alone with you and made me feel like u were trying to/ going to sneak behind my back to try to find things, look through messages with people, etc. It made me feel untrusted. 


I also feel like there were a lot of things that you could do and get away with, but if I did it it would’ve been a big fight. For example, if I were to text Gavin about anything between us bc he’s a friend you would’ve flipped out on me, but when it came to Chandler I was “overreacting” and it’s no big deal. I didn’t like the unfairness. Or like ik if I were to ever walk over to a guy for a cigarette at the bar you would’ve flipped at me, but it was no big deal if you did it. Like I know you got mad that I was talking to Asia’s cousin at the bar even though I knew him, but if u were to talk to a girl you knew at the bar it wouldn’t be a big deal. 


I also really didn’t like repeating myself either. You’d make me stg, promise, or just repeat the same things over and over throughout a week and it got exhausting, especially when something minor would happen, like a change of plans, and you would use it against me. 


I feel like you got jealous a lot too. Like if more of my attention was on my friends or something else you would be upset with me. You’ve told me before “you’re my gf, if u actually liked me you would…”. I felt like that was a little bit of gaslighting and I really didn’t like that. 


I felt like you were also very dependent on me too. If I made plans w my friends before I made plans w u/didn’t invite you bc I just wanted to be w my friends u would get upset at me and I never understood why that really affected you. That wasn’t necessarily an issue that always happened, but I noticed that. 


I also didn’t like that u would try to make me jealous or try to get a reaction out of me sometimes. Ik it happened the night at whataburger when you talked to those girls all night, the girls with the cigarettes at the bar, bringing up Jaci and talking about her ass or how she’s pretty or how you saw her. Those were turns offs for me and I felt disrespected. 


I also felt disrespected by the way you would talk to me sometimes. The night of my birthday and the text messages you sent me that night at the bar were not okay and should not be how you talk to a girl. The call we had the other night when I didn’t come over you were whining to me and yelling at me the next minute. That made me uncomfortable. 


I also really didn’t like how you would show these behaviors or start arguments in front of my friends at the bar too. It made me feel embarrassed, especially when they would try to talk to you to make u see that you’re in the wrong or upset over nothing and you wouldn’t acknowledge it or you would just say “they’re your friends. they’ll side with you no matter what, or lie”. 


I also didn’t like how I had to tiptoe or cater to your feelings over mine more often. I feel like most things were about you and had to align with your feelings over mine.  Like the night of my bday. You told me something along the lines of “show me attention or else” or you kept saying “bro fuck it” when things didn’t go your way or if I was busy. I really didn’t like that.  ","If that's the letter you received, you sound like a nightmare. You didn't trust your girlfriend, you tried to hack into her phone, you berate her any time she pays attention to another guy but think it's perfectly normal for you to chat with women. You chew her out for not paying her full attention to you and blow up when she's busy.

Quite frankly, you need to remove yourself from the dating pool until you figure out your jealous, insecure, bullshit. Do not subject another woman to your nonsense. I say that as somebody that's 45 and hasn't dated since I was your age because I won't subject somebody I have romantic feelings for to my nonsense. If you want to date, fix your shit otherwise expect to remain single and learn to come to terms with it."
i failed myself again,"i skipped another work party (a costume party to be exact) to take place next week. sadly i also skipped the party for november, and i got reprimanded for it.

I used to be a smoker and realized that while cigarettes are not good for anxiety what I appreciated was the break that made me go outside. Escape to a bathroom if you can. If not, I always leave a buffer day to literally just lay in bed with my book. Some people get energy from crowds and some do not."

clonazepam,"I took 1 mg last night around 830. Felt amazing l, went to sleep around 11, slept until 7 then 9 then 10 am. I woke up feeling so dizzy and anxious! Is this normal?",Generally some people feel an increase of anxiety (more than their usual) once a benzo medication like clonazepam completely wears off.
clonazepam,"I took 1 mg last night around 830. Felt amazing l, went to sleep around 11, slept until 7 then 9 then 10 am. I woke up feeling so dizzy and anxious! Is this normal?",It's probably normal. If this was your first time taking it then you can feel in all sorts of ways. The very first time is often different from not being used to it at all.

Tired of Feeling Like I’m Suffocating 24/7,"Hi everyone,

I’m writing this with tears in my eyes because I’m so exhausted. For the past year and a half, I’ve been feeling like I’m suffocating 24/7. It’s been almost three years of pure torture—hell, anxiety, and despair. I don’t think anyone deserves to go through this.

I’ve lost so much during this time. I’ve lost my sanity. I’ve lost my job. I’ve lost my overall health. I used to be so happy, but now it feels like everything is falling apart. I cry so often because I don’t understand why this is happening to me.

I’m not a bad person, but I feel like I’m being punished by God. Why would God punish me so hard? I don’t know what I did to deserve this. I’ve tried anxiety medications, but nothing seems to work.

Has anyone else ever dealt with this suffocation feeling 24/7? I don’t know if it’s hyperventilation syndrome, sensory motor OCD, or something else entirely. I just want to live my normal life again without being constantly aware of my breathing or feeling like I’m suffocating.

If you’ve been through this, please share your experience. I feel so lost and don’t know where to turn. Any advice or understanding would mean so much right now.","I'm relativity new to physical symptoms of anxiety so I'm not sure I'm the best person to answer this but I had trouble swallowing sometimes and needed extra effort. I'm not on any medication (which I probably should be) and my anxiety only gets super bad in the winter (It's dark, cold and depressing this time of year in Chicago) but stuff I personally do that helps me is exercise. As cliche as that sounds doing the 12-3-30 on the treadmill a few times a week really helped me with a lot of my physical symptoms."

anyone else?,"i’ve had multiple panic attacks every week since august. i’ve always had anxiety, but i feel as i get older it gets worse. every time i have a panic attack i feel like i cannot catch a full breath, cant swallow, throat closing, extreme shaking, sometimes vomiting. a new exciting addition to my anxiety symptoms is numbness in my neck and really all over my body and it is terrifying. i feel extremely disoriented every time which to me is the worst part. i feel like i need to go to the hospital every single time, and am pretty damn sure I’m dying (logically I’m not) it is the most frustrating feeling to not be able to call on logic when I’m anxious. anyone have any tips to stop panicking attacks before i try to take myself to a emergency room?

my anxiety is affecting my boyfriends mental health i need advice asap,"I have had really bad anxiety for a while now, when i went into this relationship we both were aware the other have problems. i love him so much and i consider him my safe person, so when im having a panic attack i usually go to him to help me and this has been quite a-lot recently, i think im putting some strain on him but its because i dont know how to snap out of it on my own. is there any advice for dealing with anxiety whilst being in a relationship? because i keep spiralling and i dont want to put all that pressure on him to be the person to pick me up every-time, he did speak to me and say that he cannot always be the one to help me out of my panic attacks and i have to do some of the work myself, and i have accepted that thats true and a boundary he needs, any advice on how to deal with my anxiety and not be too heavy on him with it would be appreciated ","Experiment with other techniques to see what works. Intense exercise like HIIT, a long walk outside, magnesium, theanine, cut out all stimulants, healthy nutrition, stop social media, etc."
"What does normal feel like to you, or how do you define it?","I know what life was like 2.5 years ago before my anxiety spiraled out of control. Through drugs and constant counseling, I now know that I've likely been axious since I was a kid. However, back then and up to recent I've been dealing with it somehow. Fast forward to me now, I have triggers that make me cry, but I'm not crying daily. I have days where I do get triggered and ruminate and think the whole time on those things making me anxious.

Normal to me feels and looks like ""I don't care."" What that means is that I can think of the triggers for me, and the thoughts and they just float in and out of my head. I don't ruminate on them and they don't bother me. It's when my axiety cranks up and I just sit there and think and think on the future that may or may not happen, think about the past and cry,  or whatever. I can just think and nothing bothers me. That's what I think normal is, and I've been there before. ","I think the word ""normal"" isn't helpful for people who experience anxiety, particularly those who are stuck in the constant stress response all the time. 

The word ""normal"" stigmatizes anxiety, when anxiety  is extremely common and almost universally understood by most people. Anxiety is part of the human condition. For those with chronic anxiety, the stress response has escalated and it takes longer to get back to baseline."
Quitting everything to take a break from the world was the worst decision I ever made,"I’m just now starting to realize that. If anyone has been through the same situation I would be so happy to hear from you.

I didn’t exactly quit everything as I still had my master’s thesis to write. But I did leave the city where I was studying and moved back home to my parents’ because I couldn’t handle social interactions anymore. I thought I needed some time to catch my breath and deal with everything I was struggling with. It did not get better and I’m now on meds because the anxiety is so bad.

I thought I needed some time to catch my breath and deal with everything I was struggling with. It did not get better and I’m now on meds because the anxiety is so bad. 

I’ll be starting a new job soon and I’m terrified at the idea of getting myself out there after almost a year spent at home. I just wish I could pause time and never get out of my parents’ house. Everything feels terrifying and worse than before. ",Thank you so much🤍
Does anyone know how to deal with this ,"Basically I get really anxious whenever there’s even a slight disagreement. I don’t have to be involved, but I’ve found myself hiding and stuff when other people are having a disagreement. And when older people negatively critique me sometimes I just start crying 😅 any tips? ","Anxiety is your threat system being activated. So a good question to ask is ‘what’s the main threat if people argue, or are critical of you?’ My guess is it’s related to experiencing anger. People who disagree tend to be annoyed with each other and if someone makes a negative comment towards you then you would probably experience anger towards them as what they’ve said isn’t okay"

","Well what I will say is no one has the answers in life as much as some people think they do and there will always the the opportunity cost that comes with every decision you make so as easy as it sounds don't take people's critiques to heart, especially from those that don't have your best interest at heart!"

Weird heart feeling,"I’m a 21 year old male. Lately I’ve been getting this weird feeling in my heart. It’s not pain, it’s not palpitations, it’s almost like this anxiety/butterflies in my heart. It lasts an all day sometimes but is definitely not debilitating. It makes it very difficult to sleep also. Occasionally during these phases, I’ll then have a random sharp pain and start freaking out thinking I’m having a heart attack. Like I mentioned before, I’m in college and drink quite a bit. This tends to happen more on days after I drink but it’s not necessary on those days. If I am drink while I have the feeling, it soothes it at first, but makes it worse a few hours after. It’s really starting to freak me out and I haven’t found much online about this feeling. If anyone has had this, please let me know.","I get that too, almost feels like my heart drops and then my anxiety gets worse"

Physical Anxiety symptoms help please,"Yall, this has become my new normal. This might be a little long, but I need help because at this point, I’m over it.

2016- I start nursing school. I dropped out due to tunnel vision that I thought was blood sugar related, come to find out my phobia of needles got me down bad. I dropped out. Lost a lot of weight because I couldn’t eat. Every time I stood up, I thought I’d pass out. Diagnosed with just anxiety and there was no other root cause.

I started to get better, actually got in a relationship (that’s ended—another story for another day). 

2021- I become a travel CNA. Left Georgia to go through Pennsylvania, Maine, NC, back to Georgia. I was fine until 2022, it hit me again. I was walking down the halls (florescent light gets to me I guess), and I felt out of it, went into a panic attack and left for the house. 

2022- it gets worse. I now can’t go into stores for long before I get hot, then dizzy, then dissociating. I have to leave, then it goes away.

It’s thanksgiving, and I had to leave my dads early because I felt like that. Now it’s to the point where I don’t want to be around nobody. I’m 35, no kids. Needing to date so I can have a family before it is too late. But I’m so comfortable being single, that I don’t want to do it. I’m comfortable being alone, which isn’t healthy. I have to take my anxiety meds before I even go to work. Or do anything. I’m crying typing this. It’s thanksgiving. I should be thankful. But instead I’m crying because life should be worth more. I used to be fun, outgoing. Now I’m a shell. And I don’t know how to turn this around.

I’ve tried every SSRI and it exacerbates these symptoms.","The physical symptoms kick my ass too, and typical anxiety/depression meds won’t touch them. Someone suggested propranolol to me so I’ve got an appointment soon to hopefully try it out. The holidays are rough regardless, I’m right there with you as far as thanksgiving goes. I was at my parent’s place earlier and it’s always complete clown shoes over there on the holidays. I got overstimulated almost instantly and had to reign in my panic, happens every time I have to do family stuff. Do you find that your symptoms spike when you’re unusually stressed or is it constant? Mine tend to come out swinging when my stress level increases."

Nicotine Withdrawal ,"Anyone else in nicotine withdrawal or gone through the process?  I used nicotine for almost 25 years, decreased the amount I was using the CT 19 days ago.

The first 3 days were nothing, next 2 weeks were full on depression/intrusive thoughts which was difficult but manageable.  The last 3 days have been the worst consisting of overwhelming anxiety.  I’m talking 8/10 for hours with no relief.

To add more context, I suffer from GAD and panic disorder for the last 30 years and have been through the gauntlet of meds.  Not in favor but not against.  They definitely help some people.  

During the last 2 weeks I had a good friend get hit by a car and visited him before he passed.  I am also a compulsive gambler, I had not gambled in a year but did on a few occasions during this past week until I had a long session that resulted in a loss.  I have stayed off the nicotine but am concerned how bad this anxiety will get or how long it will last.  I am seeing a psychiatrist and therapist which I have been in contact with.

Thank you 

","Hi friend, going through same experience. GAD & PD sufferer of four years and nicotine user of the last ten. 


Day 19 of cold turkey smoking quit. 



Yes. If you have GAD or PD I strongly (in my experience this quit) can attest to the fact that the symptoms and anxiousness are still burning strong nearly three weeks in. As is the lightheaded feeling. 


Anxiety does and can mimic many of the nicotine withdrawal symptoms and likewise nicotine withdrawal can exacerbate many or all pre existing anxiety symptoms. 


It's a hard slog for sure. But please keep going. Nicotine and anxiety DO. NOT. MIX. 


If you have a mental disorder I'd pay little attention to the symptomatic timelines given online."

Spasms in neck,"I’m currently having weird neck spasms when trying to go to bed. I used to have this happen sometimes when I had the worst anxiety of my life 2 years ago, but I haven’t had really any anxiety in almost a year now. I’m not sure what’s causing this but I wanted to see if anyone else has this as an anxiety symptom. ","I get the spasms in my neck too, it's kinda relieving to know someone else gets them. I actually get them all over my body but they're normally more prevalent in my neck and it's so annoying. I've found magnesium can sometimes help"
Death is coming. ,"The evening of Halloween I had a very disturbing dream. I witnessed my own death and the heartbreak of my family in the wake of it. I watch my daughter and son grow up with no father. I watched as my wife remarried and gave herself and her love to another man. And at the end of the dream, just before I woke up a dark figure told me “death is coming”. My hands are sweating and trembling just thinking about it. 

I am pagan. I believe on the evening of Samhain (Halloween)  the vail between the worlds is at its thinnest and those from the other world can interact with ours. Take that as you will but I believe I’ve been given a message. 

Ever since that day my health has started to decline. I’ve developed a heart issue where my heart beat shoots up and then drops and then shoot’s up and again and then drops, all in the course of a couple seconds. These episodes last for hours sometimes. My blood pressure is higher than normal and during the episodes has shot to 161/93. I don’t normally get too far from 120/80 as I am pretty active. I even had one of these episodes on my birthday. I had brown spot develop on my hands for no apparent reason. I get muscle cramps like crazy. My insomnia is terrible. I’m sweating profusely for no reason. My health generally feels like it is failing. 

I have been to the doctor and they didn’t know what to do. They gave me a run of prednisone for the brown spots thinking it may be a fungal infection and told me they it would take weeks to go away. It literally disappeared in a couple hours. 

The strange thing is I haven’t had an actual panic or anxiety attack since the incident on my birthday even though my anxiety has been very high. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m not looking for advice per se I just needed to vent to someone who will listen to me. My mother keeps telling me I’m just worrying myself sick and that I just need to relax but I literally feel like I am dying and there is nothing I can do to stop it. 

For the record I do have another appointment with my PCP on Monday and a Cardiologist on Wednesday so hopefully I can get some answers. I’m just worried I won’t make it until then. I spent all night with chest pain and didn’t sleep because I was scared my wife would wake up to find me dead. 

Edit: I wanted to add that after spending most of my life wishing for death, I am not scared to die. I am scared of leaving a wake of chaos behind me when I go. I am scared of my daughter not growing up with a father to teach her the proper type of partner to marry. I’m scared of my wife never recovering from the depression of the losing the man she committed her life to. I’m scared of my son not know the proper way to be a man, or worse being forced to be a man too early and not being able to be a kid. Worst of all I’m scared of never knowing my unborn baby boy. ","Wow dude - anxiety is really doing a number on you. 

Do you think all these “illnesses” could be psychosomatic? A side effect of having anxiety? 

Idk what to say man. It’s either you are very suggestible and the dream ‘convinced’ your mind and body to have these symptoms or you might actually be going through a spell of low immunity and infections. 
 
Honestly bro, if it really is that bad and it has no physiological reasoning behind it - and all your tests and scans come out as normal - you may have to seek out more unorthodox means"

","Don't know about the brown spots, but much of what you describe is textbook anxiety effects: sweating profusely, insomnia, muscle cramps. I'd add on there the feeling of impending death which could be described as a feeling of impending doom. Not sure on the blood pressure readings--anxiety can cause short term blood pressure spikes. I guess wait on the cardiologist on that one, but don't be surprised if their tests come back normal too. Plenty of people link chest pain to anxiety--that is one I have not experienced, but this subreddit is filled with people who have called ambulances and been to the ER for a feared heart attack and found out it was anxiety.

Not to dismiss your experience, but if you get the all clear from your cardiologist and PCP, I think you need to consider you have health related anxiety and seek treatment via medication and therapy. You already mentioned having an anxiety attack on your birthday, so anxiety is in the mix no matter what."

It's amazing how scared we are of the panic but when we ""let it happen"" nothing really comes of it. I used to be so scared of so many things and when I started thinking ""okay then anxiety, bring it on! Watcha got?!"" Nothing ever got worse.

Our brains are tricky..."

I do the same thing! Of thinking I've been through this countless times, come on anxiety! Give it to me! And eventually it goes away. I just try not to hyper focus on my chest and do my usual breathing+ meds. And I'm back to normal.. 

Beats a 5hr walk in hospital visit any day.

My psychologist told me about a study that was done where people who had a lot of panic attacks were all put together for a day and told to have a panic attack. They were all waiting for them to show up and ready to have one, but apparently like 80-90% didn't have anything happen. Just shows how  not fighting it can really help. Keep it up OP!"

I’m so fucking proud of myself. Small steps!","Since you seem to be having similar anxiety symptoms to me, I'll recommend that you see a cardiologist and get some tests done. After making 3 separate ER trips for what felt like potential heart attacks that turned out to be panic attacks, I went to see a cardiologist. I wore a heart monitor for 2 weeks, then I had an echo (ultrasound) test and then a stress test (walking and light jogging on a treadmill while hooked up to a monitor). All the tests came back normal, in fact, my heart turned out to be very strong. Knowing that my heart palpitations are most likely just being caused by increased anxiety or panic attacks helped to greatly reduce my overall health anxiety and now, I rarely ever worry when I feel my heart rate increase. I know that it's strong and is just doing its job. Instead of immediately panicking when I feel my heart acting differently than normal, I instead look at the situation I'm currently in. Maybe I'm busting my ass at work, maybe I just got home from a long walk or maybe I just ate a little bit too much. Knowing that your heart is fine can only be helpful in the long run.

I'm proud of you for not worrying the next time you felt palpitations. Not worrying about every little thing your body does is huge in overcoming panic attacks."

I was on the verge of googling, but stopped myself, and just kept repeating “I don’t care”. “Let it happen, don’t fight it”

Normally I’d be up all night panicking over this, but after a few minutes I calmed down and went to sleep peacefully.

I’m so fucking proud of myself. Small steps!",Thank you ☺️ Still thinking about it makes me happy as hell hahahaha

When I went to the ER, they did 3 ECGs on me. One in the ambulance, the other one an hour later, and the last one 5 hours later. They also did a chest x-ray on me. It gave me a lot of peace of mind, but I’d still love to see a cardiologist just to get that heart monitor for a while to 100% rule out everything."

Maybe it’s slightly worse for a few seconds but then it just calms down to a reasonable level. Our brains are so fucking weird!"

I’m so fucking proud of myself. Small steps!","I'm sorry, I know how rough it is to go without health insurance. I was lucky in that when I went a few years without it, I was younger and not dealing with any health problems.

Since you don't currently have the option of visiting a cardiologist, I'm going to recommend you two things. The first thing would be to stop checking in on yourself. That's been the biggest thing that has helped me with my anxiety/health anxiety. I no longer check in on myself every 30 seconds just to see how I feel, nor do I immediately start worrying if I feel my heart rate increase or tightness in my chest. It's difficult to do since it's something we subconsciously do but it will absolutely help in the long run. Letting our bodies do their thing without constantly interfering by checking in with ourselves is basically exactly what you did when you let that panic attack just happen and pass. It will build and build and build and then it will pass.

The other thing I'd recommend is the DARE app. It's been invaluable to me in managing my daily anxiety. Listening to guided meditations can be very helpful when you start to get that sinking feeling of panic kicking in.

I hope the best for you! For all of us dealing with this awfulness."

Anxiety: I get anxiety and stress pees and I have to pee so much it burns anyone else have this ? ,,"I used to be in a work  where I got used to pee quick, It ended in that same symptom, when I went to my medic he told me that it was related! So when I started to do things that calmed me down and calmed down as well the stress pee, it stopped completely! Maybe finding something that can help you slow down a bit?"

Anxiety: I get anxiety and stress pees and I have to pee so much it burns anyone else have this ? ,,How long have you had a burning sensation? And how much comes out when you pee? I hope I'm not being too personal . But a burning sensation is a classic symptom of a UTI
Anxiety: I get anxiety and stress pees and I have to pee so much it burns anyone else have this ? ,,"Maybe every time you go to pee, take a minute to check in with yourself. See how your body feels, what your emotions are. Sit with it for half a minute and just exist, instead of running around as fast as you can. If you can't be present, at least acknowledge that there are some things you just don't have to worry about until later. And then enjoy not worrying about them... Until later. If you can calm down a bit before you go pee it will probably help you a lot."

If the burning gets worse or continues for more than 24 hours see a doctor. Because that means you have a UTI . 

With a UTI you pee constantly and your urethra burns like crazy. It can bring tears to your eyes it's so bad"
Anxiety: I get anxiety and stress pees and I have to pee so much it burns anyone else have this ? ,,I'd keep an eye on it overnight. But if it's still burning by tomorrow I'd get it checked out.
Anxiety: I get anxiety and stress pees and I have to pee so much it burns anyone else have this ? ,,Nah it’s more like annoying than painful sort of pain and it just feels more like a little burn than pain and i can feel it at the end of the urethra

Anxiety: I get anxiety and stress pees and I have to pee so much it burns anyone else have this ? ,,That is what I’m thinking but it also has me freaking out lol like it’s the same feeling consistently and it’s not getting worse it’s just I can’t sleep since I need to pee so much lol and it feels like I need to pee loads but only a lil bit comes out btw thank you this is sort of distracting me 😂

Making mistakes at work (Anxiety and ADHD),"I have been chronically been unemployed because of my anxiety and ADHD. When I make mistakes at work, I tend to flee from those jobs because I get scared I will not do well and I will make mistakes again. I'm sensitive and scared of rejection and reaction, if someone screams at me or figures out I've done bad at my job. This fear stems from having constantly failed at everything growing up after attempting almost everything.  The most I've held a job is 6 months. I'm determined to stay at my new job, but I've made my first few  mistakes at it and I'm freaking out. I really need help calming my nerves. I'm scared, I don't want to lose and leave this job as well. My family is depending on me. 

I'm forgetting important things. I hate my ADHD and anxiety. I hate myself. 

I'm sorry for this vent. Someone please help me. Have you experienced this?","Thank you for sharing your feelings—it takes courage to open up. While I haven’t experienced this myself, a colleague of mine with ADHD and anxiety went through a similar situation. Here’s how he managed to cope:

**1. Structured Routine:** He used tools like checklists, reminders, and apps to stay organized. Breaking tasks into smaller steps helped him focus and avoid forgetting important things.

**2.** **Open Communication:** He talked to his manager about how he works best, asking for clear instructions and occasional feedback. This helped set expectations and eased his anxiety about making mistakes.

**3. Self-Compassion:** He reminded himself that mistakes are part of learning and growth. Instead of seeing them as failures, he started viewing them as opportunities to improve.

**4. Seeking Support:** Therapy and ADHD coaching gave him practical strategies to manage his emotions and focus better. If you can, consider reaching out to a professional or someone you trust.

**5.** **Small Wins:** He celebrated even the smallest successes, which helped build his confidence and kept him motivated.

You’re already showing incredible strength by wanting to stay and improve. Take it one step at a time, and remember—you’re doing your best, and that’s enough."

Right now I'm on my way to an Cosplay Convention and I travel with an train. It will take me around 45 minutes and I don't know why but I have incredible anxietys and my heart starts racing if I need to leave the house or like right now going to the train station and going all the way over there.

I'm not sure why and I just wanted to know if anyone can tell me what ""Illness"" this could cause...

Thanks for any answers in advance.

My diagnosis list:
Heavy Depression 
Complicated PTSD 
Anxiety disorder 
Panic disorder 
dissociative identity disorder","Well, it sounds like normal anxiety now but could lead to agoraphobia if left unchecked. It's good that you're leaving the house to go to the convention though, even though you're feeling the anxiety symptoms. 

Exposing yourself to this feeling and doing it even though you feel anxious is a great way to conquer it. The more you leave the house and expose yourself to the world, the easier it gets. I did this in college, I forced myself to go in public and I would sit and read a book or have lunch by myself, and over time it went from being a very scary thing to being a totally normal thing I was able to do. It's important to push yourself so your body and brain realizes being out of your house isn't a threat, and it's something totally survivable and okay. 

You're at the perfect age now to expose yourself to things like this so that as you go into adulthood, the anxiety doesn't take too much control of your life. I hope you have a great time at your convention!"
Escitalopram 20mg,"I'm on 15mg of escitalopram for severe anxiety (GAD), but after a month, I didn't see improvements. Today, my doctor increased the dose to 20mg. Has anyone experienced this dosage increase? I'm worried the medication isn't working anymore like it used to or that my anxiety is worsening huhu
(I took it last year but it got bad again) ","First time taking escitalopram (2 years ago) I started with 20 mg and it worked great. After a couple of months I stopped, and this year started again, first with 10 mg for a month, I think, and didn't really notice any changes, but then raised it to 20 mg and that's at least when I feel it's working, but it takes a while for it to work.

Good luck!

Edit: I'm taking it mainly for depression. I also have GAD and for that I take bromazepam for the times anxiety gets heavy, as a ""rescue"" measure."

Anxiety while grocery shopping ,I tend to get really bad anxiety when I am grocery shopping by myself. It was so bad one time that I left my cart in an aisle and ran out the door. Does anyone else experience this? What has helped you deal with it? So far my only solution is to take one of my kids with me but that isn’t always possible.,"I’ve used CBD oils with concentrations ranging from 10% to 30% from the brand Eusphera during moments of anxiety or stress. They’ve helped me feel more relaxed and calm without causing drowsiness or making me feel sluggish. What I find most valuable is that, being natural, they are gentle on the body and the digestive system, which makes them easy to use as part of my routine. I don’t see a psychologist because my anxiety isn’t severe, but after discussing it with my doctor, I was advised to try this kind of product."
Problem I’ve noticed that could be common ,"So my main form of anxiety is social and being outside ,

I’ve been trying to get fitter but I’ve a long way to go , and I’ve noticed if I’m ever outside and say walking up a steep hill etc and get a bit out of breath, this jumpstarts my anxiety and eventually causes mild panic attacks ,

Is there any way I can avoid these two things clashing ? Obviously my mind thinks higher heart rate and breathing means bad which bring on more anxiety etc. this is one of the main reasons exercise in a gym etc has been impossible for me.","Try exercising in a safe place in your house, like your bedroom or living room, somewhere  that you feel the safest at. Getting your heart rate up when you are exercising is actually a good thing and being out of breath is ok. Whenever it gets to be too much, sit down for a little bit and relax. Hope everything works out for you."
Help please,"Tw probably

Just had a nightmare and I can't sleep, I'm shaking, it was the end of the world and I died and went to hell, I don't know what to do, someone please help, tell me I'm being stupid and the world isn't going to end please, tell me I'm being an illogical idiot, I need to calm down but everything is so apocalyptic right now",It’s going to be ok. It was just a nightmare. You are safe. You are ok. Take some deep breaths and relax. Maybe get a big drink of water. Close your eyes and think of a safe warm place. You’ll be ok.
How do i stop thinking of girls or friends as the only goal in life? ,"I feel like i have to be perfect to achieve these, have a great personality, have a lot to offer, have a lot of positive qualities 

I feel desperate to get these to prove that ""im good enough"" or ""worthy"" and if i dont achieve those i feel ""worthless"" 

I dont like that its always me chasing, instead of forming genuine connections im after their approval validation attention. 

I dont blame people for not caring, why would they chase or put effort into someone who's boring? Doesnt have a lot to offer? Is negative? Is only talking to them to ""get something from them"" like filling a void or using them as a way to boost ego or be used as a replacement for my self esteem. 

And im constantly basing my self worth/happiness on external factors, i lose one game in a video game? I feel worthless, i text a girl and doesnt reply? I feel worthless, this makes me get into a deep cycle of self criticism and self doubt, that ""i cant do anything right"" 

Im constantly in performance or entertainer mode. Like a monkey trying to make others happy, putting them on a pedestal just so they dont leave or ignore. Fear of rejection and abandonment and if these happen i feel ""worthless"" 

Its never me who's being chased, liked, cared about. I always chase. 

I know that if someone likes me, or enjoys my company, or wants to be in my life i wont have to always chase them, or make it a battle to stay with them or pressure them. ","Sometimes the hardest thing we can ever do is truly be ourselves. I didn’t even know what that even meant until this year, and I am in my 30’s.

I hate to say this, my friend. But you’re not perfect. You can’t and will never be perfect. This is the most important part of you that makes you special.

When I meet someone I try to focus on their flaws, not their strengths. Strengths can be faked, flaws are unlikely to be faked. You can show me someone who’s all put together, and I will show you a person who’s is struggling, and as broken as I am.

We are all the same. We all get thrown through struggles and painful experiences. If someone wants to act high and mighty in the pig’s pen, well, they can be the king of filth then. Because we’re all basically rolling in the same things, different places perhaps. 🤔 

I am sure that analogy works on the rich and famous, too. Only their mud is a bit richer than ours. It’s still mud though. 😉"
My Ativan Experience ,"I have been consistently taking Ativan for 5 years now. I admittedly would often take a little more than I was supposed to. My prescription was one to two 0.5mg tablets as needed for anxiety. I would take it daily and sometimes I'd take 3 a day. Once in a blue moon I'd take 4. Of course this led to my pills running out early before being eligible to get a refill so the days leading up to getting a refill were a bit of a struggle since I'd have to ration them. Ativan was extremely helpful to me but I realize now that my body had became very dependent on it. A few months ago, I changed insurance companies which required me to get a new psychiatrist. This new psychiatrist did not want to continue my ativan prescription unlike my old one. She explained that ativan is only meant to be taken short term and that prolonged use can increase risk of dementia (which is terrifying) she planned to ween me off Ativan while giving me alternatives like Buspar and Propranolol. I was upset and uncomfortable about this but I understood her reasoning. Before trying Buspar and Propranolol, she tried giving me Klonopin as an alternative but I hated the way it made me feel. I felt light headed, dizzy, and I felt like it increased my anxiety while at the same time sedating me which felt very uncomfortable. She prescribed the previously mentioned medications instead and a very limited supply of Ativan if I really needed it. I was very uneasy about it but honestly... I've been okay. The Buspar takes a few weeks to take effect so I don't think I've felt anything from it yet but the Propranolol seems to be doing the trick. My main issue with anxiety is physical symptoms and she told me that Propranolol will take care of that. I no longer feel the need to have Ativan like I did before. Seldomly, I will take one on days when I feel my anxiety is high. But it's only one. Not two or three or four. And those days are becoming more seldom as time goes on. I have now realized how dependent my body was on Ativan and now that I'm without it (almost), I recognize that I'm okay. I just wanted to share my experience.","That’s really good news and glad you aren’t having too much trouble coming off the Ativan. Have you found that Propranolol impacts your sleep at all? When I tried taking it, I would wake up every couple of hours all night long. I loved the way it erased the physical symptoms of anxiety, but the sleep thing was a dealbreaker for me."

Also it would help if you would adapt the right approach towards your specific fears and worries. In a nutshell the approach is about first of all not seeking reassurance how what you're scared of won't happen. Second, accept how it might happen and add it's okay if it happens, no matter what it is. With this in mind engage in what anxiety is making you scared of and don't be avoiding any triggers. And allow yourself to feel the feeling of anxiety, not trying to stop it. This way your brain slowly rewires how it keeps registering that what you were scared of isn't that scary, making the fears weaker."

Anxiety getting back to work after a holiday ,"Hey so I’ve been on annual leave for the last two weeks and it was the first one in like couple of years (only took in like a day of every other couple of months) it was really good, but now with getting back to work I feel this constant sense of dread, like I’m sure something is going to go wrong, or I did something wrong and they spotted it while I was gone.

Anyone experiencing something similar?","I’ve experienced short term increase in anxiety when taking escitalopram. It abated within a few days. I had other odd symptoms including weird sleep issues (at first insomnia then sleeping with incredibly vivid dreams), daytime tiredness, excessive thirst, upset stomach. Almost all symptoms abated within about two weeks. It took me 6-8 weeks to notice any changes from being in meds, I was on a low dose and the changes were subtle. My anxiety didn’t exactly go away it just felt a lot more manageable, and because it was manageable, it sort of did go away. People have random experiences with it so be patient; it’s made a huge difference for me and many others. Give it a good shot before you decide whether or not it’s for you. If you decide to stop, it is advisable to talk to tour doctor first and taper off. Doc may be able to help you by splitting your dosage, or calling your script into a compounding pharmacy so you can lower your dose gradually.

How can I be sure my meds aren’t making me like high or drunk?,"I’ve never been high or drunk
I’m on sertraline, Adderall, buspirone, and lametrogene, and sometimes since being medicated I’ll be so silly around people at work or events or in general. Like I can’t stop myself from saying things that are so goofy, and like people actually think I’m funny now but they will look at me like I’m a different way. I also can’t shut up. I never was like this before and I feel anxious about what it may be doing to me cause sometimes I feel I’m loosing my mind and myself in it all","And you’re on all of this for? 

None of these make people high like that. Adderrall of course can be abused, but it doesn’t make people silly."

","Hi there! It’s brave of you to share how you’re feeling, and you’re not alone in this. A lot of people go through phases where socializing feels overwhelming or even impossible. One helpful step could be starting small—practicing short, low-pressure conversations, like a quick greeting to a cashier or a comment to someone in passing.

Another idea is to explore hobbies or activities you enjoy, especially in group settings, as it can make conversations feel more natural when you have a shared topic.

Talking to a therapist could also help. They can provide guidance on managing social anxiety and rebuilding your confidence in conversations. You're taking the right steps by wanting to improve—progress starts with intention!"
Does anyone else get burping attacks?,"This doesn't happen often thankfully, but once in a while when I am under a lot of stress and trapping air in my esophagus, I experience these terrifying attacks and I haven't been able to find any stories on here of anyone that can relate.

Basically, It starts with me 29(f) feeling like I have air bubbles coming up my throat and they become trapped. I can't burp so I repeatedly swallow to ""clear the obstruction"" and to breathe. However, I cannot get a break to breathe because one after the other the bubbles keep surfacing... I cannot keep up. It is like my throat becomes a volcano filled with pressure and I absolutely cannot stop it. The bubbles make my throat feel closed like it's hard to breathe and I just keep panting and swallowing repeatedly while pacing. It gets worse and worse and I will do this for about an hour barely breathing. The air builds up so much that all of a sudden I feel like something more is coming up, it coul be bubbles or liquid it's hard to tell really, but I feel it crawling closer to what feels like my airway by the second. Eventually I have to breathe, but when I do, I feel like whatever is coming up whether bubbles or liquid, touches what feels like my larynx and suddenly I am gasping for air and the world is spinning. I'm pacing and panting like a dog and my throat feels insanely tight. I don't have a tickle or urge to cough so I wonder if it really does go to my airway? I am not wheezing during these attacks, it just feels so tight. I also don't have redness or a sore throat if that matters. The attacks always end with a huge burp. I have aerophagia (air swallowing) due to anxiety and since the aerophagia triggers acid reflux, I can't tell if this is an aerophagia symptom or an acid reflux symptom.

Can anyone tell me whether they get this?

I don't need advice on what to do for acid reflux diet wise or medication because none of that makes a difference. It is solely caused by my anxiety. I just want to know whether others have this too and if I'm going to die.

This situation usually makes me lose my appetite and I can’t eat, it feels like there’s something coming up but I struggle a lot to actually burp? Like I have to make an effort for it to happen, and when it does I feel instant relief.

Only for it to happen again and again, I would say my case is acid reflux because my anxiety is always present in my stomach, belly, intestines, so… but I understand the “feeling in your throat”, and it can be very annoying and scary because it’s close to the heart and lungs.

I also have a fear of choking 😭"

And does the acid start before or after these burp attacks?
If you also have a choking phobia and you get all of this trapped air, you might want to consider aerophagia as a cause. It's when someone swallows or traps air due to tension and anxiety. I am constantly clenching my throat muscles and basically this traps air in the throat. This also induces reflux by putting pressure on the sphincters. Just something to think about!"
Ruining my life and travel ,"Anxiety is ruining my life when I travel. I love to go places but lately my anxiety beats me up every time because I can’t sleep. Currently on a 3 night stay in NYC.

I sleep a few hours here and there but mainly just lay there until the sun comes up, spend the whole next day dragging, drink, night time anxiety, and the cycle repeats. I love traveling to cities and exploring but I’m so afraid my anxiety is making any thought of another trip so unappealing.","Drinking alcohol is definitely not helping your situation and likely making it much worse and could potential put you into a terminal spin..

Find some other med that works for you or try some supplements probiotics etc.."

Propanalol is the biggest scam ever and it DOES NOT WORK,At least in my experience ,"Some drugs work great for others, but not for me. Calling it a scam because it didn’t help **you** is silly.

It doesn’t help if I try to use it on a daily basis for anxiety though.
Propanalol is the biggest scam ever and it DOES NOT WORK,At least in my experience ,I'm on zoloft and hydroxisine it helps a lot with managing anxiety symptoms. My hands haven't been shaking as much and my nausea is doing a lot better.

Anyone else gets the feeling that what you watch in the news will happen to you? ,"Basically it happens to me that whenever I watch movies, shows or the news and something terrible happens (real or not), I am left feeling, sometimes for days as if that is going to come true to me…. I get insomnia, panic attacks and just a general feeling of unease… 
For example I was watching a documentary where terrorists entered someones house and shot everyone, and for the rest of the day I constantly had thoughts of how unsafe my house is, how easily theyd kill me and just generally could sense as if its going to happen that same night.. 

Why is this? Anyone else experiencing it? Help?? :( 
I can only ever talk and watch soft things because otherwise I cant sleep and cant live my day to day in peace.. :(

Edit: to clarify the level, this is something that will happen to me every time I watch or talk about something slightly scary or intense… I instantly become uneasy and fearful.","I get this. It’s the part of us that plans for the future, accounts for potential dangers, maps out adventure. But for us anxious folks, it can get out of order and start worrying about every danger - even ones that aren’t real or present. Watching Inside Out 2 actually does a great job of depicting this. 

The task before us is to help calm it. To help it feel heard, but then to be able to remind it that those fears are not present or real. To try and refocus that anxious part of our brain on something that is real like a fun project, a recipe, a game. And of course it helps to try and calm it with things that calm your nervous system like tea. 

Ultimately, it’s a slow and challenging process to retrain our brains not to focus on our fears and worries but instead to focus on what we our grateful for, on peace, joy."

What you’re describing could be related to heightened anxiety or even an overactive stress response. When we watch or hear intense stories, our brain sometimes struggles to differentiate between perceived threats and actual ones, which can leave us feeling unsafe even in secure environments.

Here are a few tips that might help:

**1. Limit Exposure:** Avoid content that triggers fear for now and stick to shows or news that feel safe and comforting.

**2. Practice Grounding:** Try deep breathing or mindfulness exercises to calm your mind when uneasy thoughts arise.

**3. Reframe Thoughts:** Remind yourself that what you watch is separate from your real-life safety.

**4. Talk It Out:** Journaling or discussing your feelings with someone you trust can help ease the fear.

**5. Consider Support:** If this happens often, a therapist can provide tools to manage these feelings better.

You’re taking a great step by addressing this—things can improve!"

can SAD also happen on just a rainy day,"i live in malaysia where there's no winter just rain and gloomy weather , woke up one day feeling depressed, anxious & anxiety, I don't know what happen its been a long time since i feel like this im also having a hard time to sleep at night but i mostly feel anxious , could it be cuz i lack sunshine?","Yes, SAD mainly has to do with the lack of sunlight anyways so a cloudy/ rainy day can be depressing. Some people enjoy rainy days because they can stay inside but I hate them because grey is a depressing color."
nightmares and panic ,"This just happened and now I can’t fall back asleep, I feel watched and threatened and I refuse to leave my room or turn to my window.

I just had a very long and uncomfortable dream, the second I woke up I was certain I’ve had it before but I don’t think I have, anyway.

It all took place in my home, at night. It started with me relaxing in bed when I heard kids laughing and running past my window, for some reasons it wasn’t very odd cause it felt like they were just playing and running around. However they continued, and continued to just run around the house and past my window, it was like 5-7 kids. But suddenly they began to stop shortly by my window, and again it didn’t feel odd so I played along, scaring them when they’d come back, however I have a window kinda outside my room and one kid began to pop up there too, and the more it continued now, the more I realized it wasn’t normal..and they weren’t human. They wouldn’t stop, it just continued and I couldn’t escape it, so when I was in that window outside my room, and saw a family just standing there, I called my dad in panic. Dad came to check and he just chuckled at me “are you serious?”, he opened the door and no matter how much I protested he couldn’t see them, cause who walked in next was my older sister.
But I just knew it wasn’t really her, it wasn’t something human.

This dream has left me so uncomfortable I don’t know what to do now.","I’ve used CBD oils with concentrations ranging from 10% to 30% from the brand Eusphera during moments of anxiety or stress. They’ve helped me feel more relaxed and calm without causing drowsiness or making me feel sluggish. What I find most valuable is that, being natural, they are gentle on the body and the digestive system, which makes them easy to use as part of my routine. I don’t see a psychologist because my anxiety isn’t severe, but after discussing it with my doctor, I was advised to try this kind of product."
"If You Brush Your Teeth Every Day, Here's Why You Should Do the Same for Your Mental Health","Hey everyone,

A few years back, I was juggling a demanding job, personal relationships, and the lingering effects of anxiety that had led me to over 50 therapy sessions. One morning, as I was mechanically brushing my teeth, it struck me: I never skip this simple act because I know neglecting it leads to cavities. So why was I treating my mental health any differently?

After diving deeper into psychology (I'm currently pursuing an online master's in it!), I realized that We often wait for a crisis before we pay attention to our mental well-being, but just like dental care, mental health requires daily upkeep. 

**The Overlooked Daily Practice**

Many people aren't aware that our brains naturally focus more on negative experiences than positive ones—a tendency known as the **negativity bias**. This means we often dwell on what's gone wrong and overlook what's gone right. The good news is that by practicing daily mental health habits, we can train our brains to become more positive. This works through **neuroplasticity**, which is the brain's ability to form new connections and change over time based on our experiences.

**Simple Ways to Incorporate Mental Health into Your Routine**

1. **Morning Reflections**Instead of immediately checking my phone in the morning, I spend five minutes asking myself:
   * How am I feeling today?
   * What's one thing I'm looking forward to?
   * What can I do to make today enjoyable?

This sets a positive tone for the day and helps me stay mindful.

1. **Evening Gratitude Lists**Before bed, I jot down three things I'm grateful for. They can be as simple as enjoying a good meal or chatting with a friend. Studies show that gratitude can increase serotonin levels, improving mood and promoting better sleep.
2. **Mindful Moments**Throughout the day, I take short breaks to practice deep breathing or simply observe my surroundings. Even a minute of mindfulness can reduce cortisol, the stress hormone, and bring me back to the present.

**Resources That Have Helped Me**

* **Books:**
   * *""The Power of Now""* by Eckhart TolleThis book taught me the importance of living in the present moment and helped me understand how much time I spent worrying about the past or future.
   * *""Atomic Habits""* by James ClearA great read on how tiny changes can lead to remarkable results, reinforcing the idea that small daily practices matter.
* **Podcasts:**
   * **""The Happiness Lab"" with Dr. Laurie Santos**Explores the science of happiness with practical advice on how to live a more fulfilling life.
   * **""Where Should We Begin?"" with Esther Perel**Offers deep insights into human relationships and personal growth.
* **Apps:**
   * **LePal**Created by a close friend of mine who worked at Google and faced severe depression. She wanted to help others who can't afford or are hesitant about therapy. LePal features a “spirit pet” that makes your mental wellness journey less lonely. I journal with LePal before bed, and the spirit pet replies with insightful feedback, which motivates me to keep going. There's also a ""therapy planet"" where you can talk about your feelings to help restructure your mind. Plus, it sends weekly letters about your growth. You can add friends and family for support, strengthening your support system.
   * **BetterSleep**Sleep is a cornerstone of mental health, and this app has been a game-changer for me. BetterSleep offers a variety of sleep sounds, guided meditations, and bedtime stories that help me wind down and ensure a restful night. Incorporating quality sleep into my routine has made my morning reflections even more effective.
   * **I Am**This app sends daily positive affirmations straight to your phone. It's amazing how a simple message like ""You are enough"" can shift your mindset. These reminders help counteract negativity bias and keep me focused on the positive throughout the day.

Making mental health a routine part of your day doesn't have to be overwhelming. Small, consistent practices can lead to significant changes over time. Just like dental hygiene prevents cavities, daily mental health habits can prevent emotional burnout.

You're not alone on this journey, and it's okay to start small. If you have any practices or resources that have helped you, feel free to share them. Let's support each other in making mental wellness as habitual as brushing our teeth.

Take care, everyone! 💙

","I've tried brushing my brain, but my nose starts bleeding before I can get the brush far enough up there. 

Lame joke, I know.

Kidding aside, this is fantastic advice. I have had similar success with daily routine. Starting in the morning with some quiet reflection sets a good tone for the day. Gratitude at night reinforces all of the things that didn't go wrong even when our brains tell us they almost certainly would have. 

Journaling is another one that helps me. I write down my anxious thoughts. Something about putting them on paper helps me to see them for what they are. Like, wow, look at those; that's ridiculous. That's obviously not true.

Another app I have really liked is DARE. I highly recommend it to everyone.

And lastly, diet and exercise. Running has been a huge help for me in burning off excess energy from having a sedentary office job. And cutting way back on caffeine and sugar makes sure I'm not feeding the adrenaline beast."

anyone’s anxieties rotate constantly?,"it’s like for x amount of time i’m CONSTANTLY obsessing over health anxieties, any tiny feeling i’m googling and spiraling about. then, health anxiety takes a backseat and i’m obsessed with relationship anxiety and questioning every single thing for weeks/months at a time. THEN that starts to chill out and it’s back to health anxiety 24/7!!

and even though one anxiety category is on the back burner, it’ll still come up here and there as well, but it’s not in the forefront of my mind 24/7, until it swaps places with the other one. and the cycle starts all over. why does this happen? why am i never just doing okay???? is this OCD?","I’m no therapist, but this sounds like OCD. I would get in touch with a specialist in OCD and anxiety. I’m new to the mental health and therapy game myself (only two appointments in) but it can be a game changer.

The issue is not the thoughts, it’s the relationship to the thoughts. They don’t deserve the power we give them. Typically, people who actually want to act on these things, do something about it and don’t get obsessive over said thoughts. 

A professional can help you find ways to break that tie to you and the thought. I particularly have found CBT (cognitive behavior therapy) to be beneficial. It gets better!"
weird anxiety symptoms?,"i’ve noticed whenever im anxious or have something in the back of my mind im worried about my face and ears get hot and my stomach burns along with what feels like bloating. I feel like i have to go to the bathroom but the feeling comes and go and i cant actually. It’s just so weird and i feel like im burning up from the inside! 
",That’s fear 😥 I feel the same too when I’m anxious

"Ya I think I'm going to skip out on thanksgiving this year. Ive never missed a feast, ever in my 34 years of life.

And im about ready to tell him that I don't want to go because I feel extreme anxiety and that he can drive himself. Im 34, single, no kids. Everyones got their immediate families there. And here I am, most likely to be the only one there who sticks out like a sore thumb. Feel like everyone would expect me to have his own family. But I don't. And that's part of the stressors. It's just sad. Again, life is so short I keep reminding myself. I don't know how much more thanksgivings ill get to spend with my gramps. But I don't want to go. ","I get the extreme anxiety it sucks so bad, I'm so sorry. I will say for me I force myself to go to things for a set time so I don't make a habit of letting the anxiety win. Even if it's pulling up outside to drop off grandpa and pick him up, might help to get past some of the feelings"

And now this will be the first year not spending it at that house I grew up at.

""what's your job?"" ""What have you been up to these days, it's been a while since Ive seen you."" And I just want to be left alone. I don't feel good."

Additionally, this is an opportunity to be thankful for the time you and your family have with your Grandma. This is my first Thanksgiving without my Dad, who died in April. I'm choosing to celebrate my time with him while being sad that he's not here. We can do both.

When talking to family, I'm very honest. ""No kids yet?' - No, I'm not in a place in my life for that. Job is pretty straightforward. You are where you are in life."

Anyone else’s anxiety get worse during the holidays?,"first off, happy thanksgiving to those who celebrate. i hope everyone has a safe & happy holiday today.

but that’s also just not why, the past two years have been such a struggle during the holidays for me. i lost my grandpa two years ago who made the holidays very lively. any holiday or occasion is just not the same. then after that, my (now) ex step grandma decided to cut contact (blocked me and entire family on everything) randomly & move states away. my nana moved states away due to health reasons and half my family is in a different country. friend wise, this year, i lost so many friends. i barely have anyone to wish a happy thanksgiving/holidays, buy gifts for, go out with, etc. 

now that im older (22) & have dealt with so much loss, i get very anxious & upset around the holiday season. every single one is just different. it’s always hard to adjust to & never gets easier. anyone else that goes through this, just know you’re not alone & im sending hugs your way.

Had a dream I relapsed now I’m freaking out,I’ve been in a bad place mentally and just woke up from a dream where I relapsed on cocaine and woke up terrified. I’ve been clean over 5 years but still think about it all the time and especially now with certain aspects of my life bringing me down. I just want drugs to end my anxiety but it’s also causing me anxiety to even think about and I hate it. Stupid relapse dreams have me up at 2am watching twitch streams to calm down. Ugh I’m gonna go for a smoke and hope I can calm down. Any recovering addicts get relapse dreams and how do they impact your anxiety?,"Also a cocaine addict , still get coke dreams sometimes i don’t know if there’s something to do about them . But it’s just a dream you know as long as you clean you’re good"

I’ve used CBD oils with concentrations ranging from 10% to 30% from the brand Eusphera during moments of anxiety or stress. They’ve helped me feel more relaxed and calm without causing drowsiness or making me feel sluggish. What I find most valuable is that, being natural, they are gentle on the body and the digestive system, which makes them easy to use as part of my routine. I don’t see a psychologist because my anxiety isn’t severe, but after discussing it with my doctor, I was advised to try this kind of product."

Hello, 

I want to prephase that I love food, and I am really afraid to develop an ED because of my anxiety. 

The issue is - my body ""forgets"" how to swallow and I am sitting with a food mash in my mouth that is not moving either up or down, so I start to panic. This really hinders me from eating, I am getting extremely anxious during meals, and of course I don't eat. I have barely eaten for a couple of days now as I am extremely anxious about choking to death. 
I have not choked, but I am so afraid of it. 

I am trying to distract myself of be mindful og consistency of food, but after few bites - my body ""forgets"" how to swallow and my mind goes spiraling. I manage to drink just fine, though. 

I would really appreciate some advice and support on how to deal with this. I work with a therapist, but its still some time til the next session...

weird head sensation in the transition of wakefulness to falling sleep,"while i was trying to sleep, i kept getting this on and off feeling of my head feeling super lightheaded/ rush feeling/ falling feeling and my hearing would go in and out while it does it. 
at first i thought it was kind of a relaxing feeling , but it wouldn’t stop and i couldn’t fall asleep and it started scaring me. 
once i finally got close to going to sleep i felt my heart beat slower and i just got this over all feeling of complete doom and it woke me completely up out of my sleep. all of my tiredness disappeared and i just started panicking. 
its really hard to explain how it felt but i was wondering if anyone else has experienced something like this…?🙁 ","I’ve used CBD oils with concentrations ranging from 10% to 30% from the brand Eusphera during moments of anxiety or stress. They’ve helped me feel more relaxed and calm. I also use them to sleep better, helping me avoid waking up frequently during the night and making it easier to fall asleep. What I find most valuable is that, being natural, they are gentle on the body and the digestive system, which makes them easy to use as part of my routine. I don’t see a psychologist because my anxiety isn’t severe, but after discussing it with my doctor, I was advised to try this kind of product."
Anxoety insomnia,Anyone else get bad insomnia due to their anxiety I sleep like 2 hours and wake up in absolute panic then can't sleep again. I'm honestly exhausted stressed and just want some sleep instead of having 22/24 hours with constant anxiety.

Been trying to sleep since 12 am but it's not 2am and no luck.

Tried sleep gummies and meditation, no luck, It sucks."

Fast heart rate and skipping beats.,"Im worried somethings wrong today, i have a consistently high heart rate and skipping even though i dont feel anxious at all. my heart rate is 120 bpm and 100 at rest, but my blood pressure and temp are normal. i have a history of PVCs and bigeminy but they went away for a week or so now im having this. should i be concerned?","PVC’s can still happen without anxiety. Might be worth a cardiology check up, they can do a holter monitor to check your arrhythmias and burden. If it’s high enough they may offer treatment options. If it’s not, you’ll get the reassurance you’re good to go :) try not to check your heart rate in the mean time, it may just increase it and give you a false idea of how high it is."

Did anyone else's anxiety start a few years before the depression creeped in?,"With me I had general anxiety starting around age 19 and then depression developed about age 22, just wondering was this the same for anyone else ?","Yes, anxiety tends to lead to depression if not treated properly, which is one of the reasons why it pains me to read threads and comments of people saying sth like ""keep fighting and you'll get over it."" At least some of those here have an anxiety ***disorder***, which is a mental illness that involves, among other things, an imbalance in their brain chemistry. They won't be able to ""get over it"" because their brain is malfunctioning and needs more than just ""positive vibes"". And while they're out there trying to fight anxiety away, they're walking towards not only making their disorder worser but also developping depression.

Unfortunately, I only learned about all that *after* I was diagnosed with both GAD and chronic depression. By that time, around six years ago, I had been living with both illnesses for over a decade without knowing it due to pure lack of information. Although I no longer fit the conditions for clinical depression, I'm still in treatment due to anxiety, and probably will remain so for the rest of my life. And I don't mind. After over a decade slowly and unawarily walking toward self-destruction, I'm glad I'm still here. Just wish I could've been diagnosed sooner and started treatment sooner."

While some types of anxiety can be cured or at least become less severe with just a few changes in lifestyle, for instance, there are others which can't.

Why me ? Why now ,"Hey everyone,
I’m 26 years old, and recently I’ve started experiencing something that feels like anxiety or panic attacks. It’s really overwhelming, and I’m not sure what’s going on.

I feel this constant pressure on my chest, but my breathing seems normal. At the same time, I’m stuck in this state of constant worry and fear. On top of that, I feel this tingling sensation on my right cheek that won’t go away. I just want it all to stop.

My mind understands that I’m in a cycle of panic, but I can’t seem to break free from it. At my worst moments, thoughts like suicide have crossed my mind—not because I actually want to do it, but because my brain feels like it’s spiraling. I know I’d never act on those thoughts, but it’s terrifying to even feel that way.

I don’t understand why this is happening to me, and I just need it to stop. Has anyone else gone through this? Any advice or support would mean the world right now.

Thanks for reading.","Just here to say I can relate. I had a pretty intense (traumatic?) experience a few months ago when one of my dogs suddenly got very sick and passed away, paired with a few other things. One night right after that I had a panic attack, and nothing has felt the same since then. I’ve felt the intensity in my chest, nausea every morning. Worried thoughts and rumination about all the ‘what ifs’. In many ways now it feels like I’m just anxious about being anxious, instead of about any specific memory or thought. My body is just extra sensitive to worry, drawn to anxiety. Before I might have read something about someone getting bad news from a doctor and felt sorry for them. Now it immediately spikes my anxiety and I notice my heart rate increasing. Or I notice my remaining dog acting a little different and I start to worry. I described it to my therapist as it feeling like my anxious part got zapped with gamma radiation, and now when it’s just trying to do its normal job of anticipating problems, planning, helping, it goes into hulk mode gripping into my gut and chest.

But, I have felt significant improvement over the past four months. Life is not back to normal. “The only constant is change”. But I do feel hope that some new version of normal will come with time. I gets tastes of it some hours of some days. And more hours of more days each month. Many days still feel like the best I can do is try and get through it, but the glimpses I get if my mind feeling clear again - feeling like the lightness returns to my heart and mind, and I’m not even thinking about the anxiety. They give me hope and motivation to keep going."

Thanks for reading.","I'm sorry you're going through this! At least you're aware that it's anxiety and it's just your brain being mean.

Same thing happened to me a couple of years ago: started having panic attacks seemingly out of nowhere, regularly. After a lot of trial and error, I found some things that help take your mind off of your anxiety so that you don't feel worse. 

For me, it was all about distraction so maybe watch a comfort TV show or movie, or something that makes you laugh? Also doing light exercise helped get some of the nervous energy out. Do you have any hobbies, or have you thought about starting one,  that involve your hands?

Totally up to you, but therapy has also been super helpful in learning to deal with it and finding out where it came from. 

I'm sure you'll get a lot of good advice from the community, so hopefully something will help! Good luck and take care of yourself!"

Thanks for reading.","I'm so sorry you're going through this right now. I would highly recommend two audiobooks. Dare by Barry Mcdonagh and Hope and Help for your Nerves by Dr Claire Weekes.

They are so reassuring and practical. 

Basically your nervous system has got a bit overloaded for whatever reason and that can set if feedback loops until you manage to downregulate your nervous system response.

I promise you won't always feel like this and it is totally treatable and very common. 

I'd also recommend doing to the doctors and seeing if they can put you forward for some CBT. I did an online mindfulness based CBT programme called Silvercloud through thr doctor, it was really helpful. 

The other thing that really helped me was doing this relaxation app daily called Sorted Mental Health. There are lots of different ones but the doctor also recommended me that one and it's evidence based and has the option of birdsong over the guided relaxations which I really liked. 

After I got over the worst of my anxiety and understood what was happening I started to try to make a mental note when I felt bad, like ""OK I'm feeling anxious, now what"" and I found that this often reduced the power of the feeling, more than when I tried to distract myself or push it away. 

That starts to retrain your brain to knowing it's actually safe. You can say to yourself that you are safe, anxiety can't hurt you etc and find a way to talk to it. 

Some people also recommend squeezing an ice cue or rubbing ice over your face and neck to diminish panic attacks. And somtimes just jumping up and down, signing, dancing etc can help as your body is like OK I'm actually fine. 

Also walking in nature, going to do things which aren't too stimulating. Stopping caffeine etc all helped me too. 

Wish you the best in feeling better soon!!"

I am not in any way diminishing your anxiety. But the unexpected arrival needs to be questioned. 

Is there something significant going on right now? Anything that could cause this?

Why me ? Why now ,"Hey everyone,
I’m 26 years old, and recently I’ve started experiencing something that feels like anxiety or panic attacks. It’s really overwhelming, and I’m not sure what’s going on.

I feel this constant pressure on my chest, but my breathing seems normal. At the same time, I’m stuck in this state of constant worry and fear. On top of that, I feel this tingling sensation on my right cheek that won’t go away. I just want it all to stop.

My mind understands that I’m in a cycle of panic, but I can’t seem to break free from it. At my worst moments, thoughts like suicide have crossed my mind—not because I actually want to do it, but because my brain feels like it’s spiraling. I know I’d never act on those thoughts, but it’s terrifying to even feel that way.

I don’t understand why this is happening to me, and I just need it to stop. Has anyone else gone through this? Any advice or support would mean the world right now.

i might have just granted myself so much relief,"so basically since sunday ive been stressing over one symptom, that being 'shortness of breath'. although, calling it shortness of breath has felt weird, because my o2 levels are solid, the stethoscope tells my nurse mother that everything sounds good, ekg is good, heart rate is normal. everything reads fine.

Id prefer to call it 'mild difficulty getting a satisfying breath'. im still able to yap my ass off, sing songs, walk fine, etc. anyways, what im trying to say is i have a strong feeling my symptom is not that of anything serious (knock on wood).

I believe that my shortness of breath has come from my CAT (who i am not allergic to). Everytime i come home from college, i have this shortness of breath that i cant shake. Well, my cat sleeps in my bed 24/7. she lives in my room because my moms dogs would slaughter her. My bed is a literal HAYSTACK of hair. like hair EVERYWHERE. And after some googling, ive found that breathing in an excessive amount of hair can ""irritate your airways and cause coughing, discomfort, or even mild breathing difficulties"". I am convinced i have been breathing in so much cat hair from this animal that it has made my life this past week an anxious hellhole. I am BEYOND convinced.

I scheduled an entire docs appt next friday, and i go back to school Sunday. If im feeling back to normal i am going to be SO mad but so damn happy that i was worried about nothing. 

Thanks for the rant lol.","reckon, my anxiety probably made it worse than it is. also i’ve gotten stress rash on my chest twice this week from being anxious about this. So im really hoping this is all that it is."

Just let the passion grow as you stick to something and then allow alcohol to serve as a negative that will hurt your focus. That way you can leverage your passion as something more worthy than drinking. Idk just a thought I’m probably wrong in that approach lol

I have a long history of problem drinking. Started as binging once in a blue moon in high school and through college. Once I moved out and got on my own, I was binging every weekend. That turned into binging on some weekdays. Eventually, it was everyday. I was a heavy drinker for three years or so, and for probably 1.5-2 of those years I was drunk daily. 

Panic attacks and anxiety run in my family, and once I got sober something in my brain got messed up and sent anxiety into overdrive. 

I've been 100% alcohol free for 3.5 years now and never looking back. Unfortunately, anxiety is still here and I'm still getting panic attacks. Medication has helped some but I don't know if my brain will ever be normal. 

Heart disease is also one of my biggest fears. Any little odd sensation in my chest sends my anxiety skyrocketing, which stinks because chest pain/stiffness is an anxiety symptom. So it's a really awful cycle. 

You aren't alone OP. Please seek help from a doctor if you can. I promise you help is out there and your situation will be taken seriously. 

Wishing you safety and healing."

How do you cope with work anxiety?,"My main anxiety trigger is definitely work and thinking about my future. The pressure at work to be socialiable, creative, come up with new ideas, a confident presenter, constantly chasing career development and keeping up with your industry sets me off. Most of these things do not come naturally to me at all and I really struggle with simple things despite having a job for a few years now. I also really struggle with job interviews and selling myself, especially as the job market is so competitive and the salaries where I live are low compared to the cost of living (I am not in a specialized or lucrative industry). I try to avoid thinking about it but the idea of having to do this for the rest of my life fills me with so much dread. How are the rest of you who struggle with this coping? I don't feel like a proper adult because no-one else seems to have anxiety this bad about working.","I have had similar anxieties related to work/career in the past.  Currently I have a corporate office job.  I am introvert who tends to lack self-confidence, and I generally don't fit in well with corporate culture where extroverts and those good at networking are the ones who tend to get ahead.  

I also can never really force myself to be enthusiastic about work.   I work in an interesting industry, but I find it very unfulfilling.  To me it will always be just a paycheck, and just something I have to do 40 hours a week to keep a roof over my head.  

What helped me a lot is to just stop caring so much.  I make sure I do my job well, but I don't stress about being perfect, or fitting in to corporate culture.   I came to realize that it's irrational to constantly fear losing your job over minor imperfections, because it is a huge hassle for a company to interview, hire, and train a new person to replace you.   

So I do my job to the best of my ability each day, I go home at 4:30, and then I try not to think about work at all until the next morning at 8:00.   I don't stress out about making an occasional minor mistake, or generally not being as extroverted and enthusiastic as everyone else in the office.  If the company decides that they don't want me to work for them anymore, oh well.  At the end of the day it's just a job.   You'll find another one if you have to.   I am 41 years old and i've gone through a few career changes since I entered the workforce, both planned and unplanned.  Things have a tendency of working out when they need to.  

It also helps to have some hobbies you can immerse yourself into on the evenings and weekends.   Gives you something to look forward to, and helps you not to think about work as much.  If you are constantly stressed about work, then it tends to spill over into your personal life as well.   What also helped me a lot was seeing a therapist and being able to discuss these issues."

I work in a creative industry and I’m always over compensating and overworking because of work anxiety. I’m scared of being seen as contributing less and I’m scared of presentations and talking to people. I feel I’ll say something stupid and reveal that I’m just an imposter. This despite my boss acknowledging my hard work.

Therapy has been helping me of late. I’m learning how to relax and see work as just a part of my life and not my entire identity. I’ve a long way to go but I’ve made small steps towards a healthier mindset. A lot of my anxieties were rooted in childhood trauma. I’m going to try EDMR with my therapist tomorrow. Hopefully it helps."

What I find most valuable is that, being natural, they are gentle on the body and the digestive system, which makes them easy to use as part of my routine.

But if you have been at your job successfully for a few years, I think you may have more value to the company than you might think.  Plus if you think about it, for the company to replace you...they'd have to post a job ad, interview people, spend money to onboard and train them, all for a 50/50 chance that new person may bail for another job anyway in a few months.   So maybe you are being a little too hard on yourself, and seeing the situation through the lens of anxiety.   I know because I was (am) the same way.  

If you feel your line of work is truly not a good match for you, that's ok.  It's super common for people to pick a line of work, come to the realization its not a good match for them, and change careers.   I guess i'm on my 3rd career change at this point.   10 years ago I had a somewhat menial job which I hated, and thought I had no other options and would have to do it forever.  But now years later I can look back and see that it was just a stepping stone that kind of indirectly helped lead me to the gig I have today.   Its not perfect, and I still often struggle with finding fulfillment with work, but its tolerable.   

If you do decide to leave for a different job, you're at the advantage now where you can build your resume and look for jobs at your leisure (since you are already working) and you can afford to be picky to an extent and wait for a job you really want.  

Regarding therapy, I know it can be expensive.  I am only able to go because my insurance covers it (I'm in the US).   You could always check out YouTube, there are many channels that have some good content.  ""Therapy in a Nutshell"" was one channel that I found helpful.  

Career anxiety was something I really struggled with before, and still do to an extent, so I certainly can relate.  But I was able to sort of reframe how I viewed the situation through therapy and practicing a certain level of acceptance.   I hope things get better for you!"

I think I’ve subconsciously led myself to believe that I’m going to suck at presentations. I need to challenge this belief.

I have phases where I actually don’t give a shit about work because the stress is too much to handle. And then I have phases where I’m overworking because I’m scared that I’ll be seen as an imposter.

Therapy has been helpful. Maybe you should try it out too. There’s also a book on work anxiety which I found helpful. It’s called ‘Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff’. 

I like my job but not at cost I have to pay in stress and anxiety. I too am not sure where I’m headed. I don’t really have any long term goals. My only goal for now is to work without feeling anxious and stressed all the time. I envy how some of my peers treat their jobs."
Anyone else also have anger issues?,How do you manage those?,"Yes, I hide in my room and try not to talk to anyone so I don’t hurt them."
Anyone else also have anger issues?,How do you manage those?,"Sometimes you just need to beat the shit out of something. I’ve been into boxing most of my life, it’s a great outlet for a bunch of piled up rage, and it’s fun. You don’t have to be good at it to enjoy it either, it’s really satisfying."
Hungry,"Finals season is upon us and my anxiety is really not responding to my meds as much as it did. Now I’m hungry but the thought of eating makes me super nauseous. Any ideas on how to eat? Like thanksgiving was me clutching my fists and sweating trying not to puke.

Thanks","I’ve used CBD oils with concentrations ranging from 10% to 30% from the brand Eusphera during moments of anxiety or stress. They’ve helped me feel more relaxed and calm without causing drowsiness or making me feel sluggish. What I find most valuable is that, being natural, they are gentle on the body and the digestive system, which makes them easy to use as part of my routine. I don’t see a psychologist because my anxiety isn’t severe, but after discussing it with my doctor, I was advised to try this kind of product."
Hello good night :3 just because I have insomnia again ,"Have you ever had that feeling of wanting to cry so badly but you can't, and you just hold it in but there are moments when you stop breathing and when you come up for air again you feel the very strong heartbeats throughout your body?",U should probably cry
Minor injuries set off pain-anxiety cycle?,"This might sound a bit strange and I feel like I’m alone in this, but I have a GAD and I’ve been under a lot of stress recently. I had a chiropractic maneuver the day after Labor Day which caused severe pain at first and has now become consistent chronic muscle tension. I’ve been to PT for two months and my therapist agrees that, if I did sustain an injury from the maneuver, it shouldn’t be severe enough as to linger this long — as such, I’m thinking that this constant neck and upper back pain, tension, and stiffness is from my GAD.

What I mean to ask is: has anyone experienced a relatively minor event being turned into a pain-anxiety cycle and being totally blown out of proportion by your anxiety? I genuinely feel alone and crazy here and it would be great to even hear a single person sharing a somewhat similar story.

I started Lexapro two weeks ago, and though my IBS has gotten a bit better my muscle tension is still ever-present.","Yes. I have been in the pain-anxiety loop for three months, but I actually have disc problems. It's all rooted in unresolved fear, more specifically your survival instinct of not being able to survive if your incapacitated. I follow Eckhart Tolle. He has phenomenal insights on fear and many other things. He changed my life."

Does anyone else worry about if they like their interests,"To start, I've never been diagnosed with anxiety nor do I think that I have it, but I couldn't think of a better server to post this on. I do, however, have random thoughts whenever I watch the shows I like about if I dislike them. I know that I like them, I just end up working myself up about it. Is that a problem anyone else may face?","yah man. just like a week or two ago, i'm working myself up over if i actually like the type of music im into or if im just ""faking"" it. i still do it to this day but nevertheless still continue to listen to the same shit and just typically ignore these random thoughts. not even just music too like even my mind would make me doubt the type of movies i like. i just keep doing what i do normally tbh."

It was really hard at first but after a couple of months I started to feel better. I still have relapses from time to time but it’s usually once or twice a year. Compare that to panic attacks at least once a week and really bad insomnia. I was in a constant state of worry and stress. It’s a lot better but definitely did not cure it. For me at least it’s still worth it. I rather have anxiety a couple weeks out of the year versus months out of the year.

Weird heaviness in heart.,I don't know I've easily been stressed and when I logically have tried and calmed myself I still feel the heavyness in my heart. What do I do to make it go away?,Marijuana
Weird heaviness in heart.,I don't know I've easily been stressed and when I logically have tried and calmed myself I still feel the heavyness in my heart. What do I do to make it go away?,Take theanine or drink a shit ton of tea. Get stronger meds if needed from a psychiatrist. Take deep breaths. Watch something that is sufficiently distracting and engaging and makes you happy. Or go do something that is sufficiently engaging and distracting
Weird heaviness in heart.,I don't know I've easily been stressed and when I logically have tried and calmed myself I still feel the heavyness in my heart. What do I do to make it go away?,"You will be okay, I know it seems impossible at the moment but just know and trust that this won't last forever. Try splashing cold water on your face to shock you, or dunk your face in a bowl of cold water for 20 to 30 seconds, apparently this resets the nervous system? Try taking deep breaths, but when you breathe out, verbally hum out loud, this stimulates the vagus nerve apparently which will help to calm you. Stand outside in the cold, hold an ice cube, wash your hands with cold water. Try your best to read a book, or do something you like or used to like- it can take 10 minutes to overcome the beta blockers in your mind to really enjoy something. Do something that will really distract your mind, like counting back from 100 in 3s, sounds silly but it works. Uhhh, drinking tea, I've found ginger tea is soothing. A hot tea or a hot bath/shower, it's comforting for the body. Remember to eat well and drink enough water and sleep well. Stretch before bed, develop a night routine. Connect with nature, really focus on the things around you. You can do this, stay with us, friend 💪

The heaviness in the heart for me has gone away but it took a lot of acceptance. Accepting that it's there. I've been told mine is because of my body storing unresolved trauma and I've started trauma work to try release all of that built up trauma. You should look into therapy to really help you. Everything will be okay. I know it's impossible to think that it will but it really will be. You will be okay. You can do this, I'm proud of you. Live, as long as you do- that's enough."
Meds Question ,"Hello my fellow anxious people. Currently I am on 20mg of cipralex, and now my doctor has added on 150mg of Wellbutrin. I also take Ativan almost daily to help with my wild panic attacks. 

My question is.. will Wellbutrin make any difference in my anxiety, or does it work mainly for depression.. which I do have, but my anxiety outweighs literally everything and it’s beginning to become unbearable 

","I have anxiety and depression. I’ve never been on Cipralex but I was on Zoloft for most of my life, a few years ago added 300 MG Wellbutrin because the Zoloft was doing nothing for my depression, but my anxiety was pretty under control. Adding the Wellbutrin made my depression so much better, but has made my anxiety much worse. I try to convince myself it’s worth the trade. Of course medications can work differently for everyone.


I’m actually curious to know how you went about getting on Ativan almost daily. Any time I’ve gotten it they give me like 10 pills and I have to ration them for absolute emergencies only."

If you search ""air hunger"" on this sub you'll probably see a few things you can try.



For me, I stumbled across a video a while ago that described a technique where you take a deep breath in, do a few more short gasps in, then exhale. In my experience most breathing exercises make this feeling worse but the weird gasping thing satisfies it somehow. It also helps me to focus on breathing into the belly instead of the chest."

To get better you must eliminate your anxiety related behavior such as checking if something is wrong, repeatedly seeking reassurance or avoiding whatever scares you.

","In a few weeks I will be alone with my daughter for 4 days, so technically not alone, but still feel alone because I’m afraid to panic or have a medical emergency and not be able to care for her. Oh my gosh, I spiral into these worst case scenarios in my head.

It is so frustrating. So when your partner goes to work (I assume everyday?), do you always panic? And then the feeling subsides?"
how to stop having anxiety attacks at school?,"i recently started going to college and ive realised that every time im walking to class, i start sweating, getting runny noses, struggling to breathe and as soon as i sit down in class, the sweating gets worse and i find it so embarrassing. after while my sweating stops but every single day at the start of class these attacks happen. i'm on antidepressants (20 mg fluoxetine) right now so idk if that's the cause. any tips please? ","I’ve used CBD oils with concentrations ranging from 10% to 30% from the brand Eusphera during moments of anxiety or stress. They’ve helped me feel more relaxed and calm. I also use them to sleep better, helping me avoid waking up frequently during the night and making it easier to fall asleep. What I find most valuable is that, being natural, they are gentle on the body and the digestive system, which makes them easy to use as part of my routine. I don’t see a psychologist because my anxiety isn’t severe, but after discussing it with my doctor, I was advised to try this kind of product."
I'm scared I'm going crazy,"I know, I know we all have this fear and it seldom comes true. But I seriously am afraid. I have had an incredibly stressful month or so and it has led to a considerable anxiety relapse.

I've been feeling burnt out between my work, social, home, and dog caretaking responsibilities. I feel the need to be ""perfect"" in the way I take care of it all and it's exhausting. 

Anyway, I feel crazy. Not like ""I'm seeing things"" crazy, but rather I just don't feel like myself. I'm irritable, oversensitive, panicky, and on edge. I'm having a lot of trouble sleeping.

I've been burned out from work since 3 years ago and I'm even more so since my daughter was born along other issues that go with it. Sometimes you need a break and turn off your brain. send out a text to your friends you are taking a break from your phone or life, for lack of better wording, turn odd your phone and be a couch potato for a day or 2. 

I wish I could but that's barely possible with an almost 2 year old at home.

I've been having a serious anxiety relapse as well. Lexapro has pretty well gotten rid of it for a while but now it's back. Got a doctor's appointment scheduled for tomorrow to talk about chest/neck stiffness and palpitations that I 100% know is my anxiety but cannot get away from the thought that I have something wrong with my heart. 

Anxiety sucks. And so does introversion. I'm probably the most introverted person on the planet, and frequently burnout just from short, everyday interactions. This time of year is particularly bad for that. 

You're not crazy at all. And I know it's hard in the moment because anxiety convinces you of a lot of bad stuff, but it won't hurt you. You're not going to suddenly go crazy. 

Try to take it easy on yourself and do small relaxing things you love to do. If you haven't already, it may help to speak to a doctor to make sure nothing more serious is going on. They can also help you find the right resources you need. 

For me, a mix of hot showers, hot decaf tea or coffee, good books, light walks, easy going cycling sessions, and big hugs from my wife can turn things around."

I started a new job, a second job, recently. The second job offered benefits too, and I signed up for them today.

I didn't add that because it wouldn't let me move past the page and proceed with other parts of registration like name, phone number, address, etc so I clicked another option to move on.

Can you help me?"" so no excuse embedded at all. If the person on the phone is like ""sure thing bud, i'll get that done for you"" then there's no need to bring up an excuse.

It's a coincidence you brought up making up an excuse. Because I've already been preparing conversation scenarios in my head if the call didn't go that smoothly. If they pressed me with ""why didnt you input your other benefit's info when signing up?"" I was thinking of coming up with an excuse like ""i wasn't able to navigate the registration properly""/""i didn't know how to move to the next screen to add my personal details, because i couldnt figure out how to add my personal details AND add my first insurance info together"" (which are both true).

I was panicking today and thinking of grabbing my phone and calling within the hour of submitting my online registration, but then I thought that if I called now, well, my info is probably not even in their database yet, and it'd probably confuse them. So I thought it'd be best to wait until I receive a welcome package/plan ID number/account login credentials (so I know I'm in their database), and *then* call them. It'd probably take them until next week for them to reach that point, depending on how fast they are, so I was thinking of calling them Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday - whenever they've got back to me. 

Is that still fast enough time? I hope so. (And I definitely don't have any desire to submit any claims to anyone until this is sorted out, so no worries on that front.)"

I would check both plans and see which offers the best deductibles, network and out of network coverage, etc.  Then whichever you want to be your secondary just let that company know.  The important part is when you visit a doctor or hospital to list both of them as your primary will be billed first and your secondary will be billed any balance left over from the first company.  Leaving that info off is not a problem at all.  The insurance companies don't really care about being primary or secondary.  They are only going to pay claims that are coming from your doctors.  What is more important is that the doctors know who to bill first (primary).  They will only bill you secondary after an EOB has been sent to them showing what your primary paid and how much the remaining balance is."

"GF struggling, what can I do to help?","My girlfriend (25) has dealt with anxiety for years now, but over the last few months it's gotten significantly worse. Her doctor doubled her anxiety med dosage and increased the frequency from 2x a day to 3x. She constantly on the verge of an anxiety attack and is very tense all the time.
I want nothing more than to help provide some relief/comfort. We don't live together; we're both college students living with our parents. But whenever we get to see each other I try to talk about light topics and provide her with warmth, water, food, attention (or space if required), etc. I've asked her if anything specifically helps the anxiety settle, whether it's an activity like watching TV, playing games, doing puzzles - or if it's a mindset like not worrying about assignments being due or accomplishing a task. But she says that nothing helps whatsoever.
I understand anxiety is different for everyone, but does anyone have suggestions as to what I can say/do to provide comfort? What are some things that help yall out? What helps calm an anxiety attack? I only have a vague understanding of what anxiety is like, but not anywhere near what she's going through.
Any input is greatly appreciated!

TLDR: I need ideas on what I can do for my girlfriend to help her with her anxiety","First I give you credit for trying to understand as much as you have. 25m and it is a very personal experience. Honestly, the biggest advice I can give you is to protect your mental health because there really isn’t much you can do. Comfort is great and being there and listening is what you need to do but don’t expect to be able to alter any of her feelings because anxiety is literally the devil himself. The only thing that has helped me with panic attacks is holding ice cubes. Tell her to hang in there. It’s tough. I’ve been battling for 3 years and I lost a 5 year relationship in the process."

TLDR: I need ideas on what I can do for my girlfriend to help her with her anxiety","I’ve used CBD oils with concentrations ranging from 10% to 30% from the brand Eusphera during moments of anxiety or stress. They’ve helped me feel more relaxed and calm. I also use them to sleep better, helping me avoid waking up frequently during the night and making it easier to fall asleep. What I find most valuable is that, being natural, they are gentle on the body and the digestive system, which makes them easy to use as part of my routine. I don’t see a psychologist because my anxiety isn’t severe, but after discussing it with my doctor, I was advised to try this kind of product."

We're still together and I've noticed her making efforts to maintain a connection/relationship, and I'll reciprocate it - but I also don't want to smother. I kinda feel things out as I go, but her mental health is more important to me than our relationship status. If me being with her helps then I'm happy to stick with it, but if being separated provides her the space she needs and helps her out then I'll be okay with that too.

Had my first severe panic attack and I can’t yawn or relax anymore. How to? ,Last night I had my first server panic attack. As the title states I can’t yawn. I looked into why I can’t and I’m just wondering how do I calm my nervous system down now? ,"There are different ways to calm your system down. There is the box breathing, distracting yourself, meditation, music, white noise, Journaling but it all depends on what works for you. For example, I can't journal cuz when I do I focus too much on rhe shitty things vs good things. 

For panic attacks, I sit on the toilet, try to breathe thru it, sometimes I will read something or watch a funny video on YouTube. Slowly but surely I calm down"

8 years of agoraphobia and anxiety,"I’ve been having agoraphobia and anxiety for years now. When it first started I was having panic attacks every day when leaving the house. I got put on medication for anxiety and it helped a lot, but gave me very bad side effects of anhedonia, not wanting to do anything and not enjoying anything. I reduced my dosage and it has helped with the lack of enjoyment, but the anxiety has never truly gone away. I consistently have anxiety about having anxiety and panic attacks. I have fear of getting sick in front of people, having panic attacks in front of people, not being able to escape from a situation. It’s effected my for years, and recently has been extra frustrating as my girlfriend wants me to go to all of her family functions with her where I’m with her family anywhere from 4 hours to 8 hours to multiple days away. I want to get over this so badly, it’s been so debilitating. Does anyone have insight on what has helped them? Anxiety about getting anxiety, having panic attacks and not being able to get away from a situation and go home is horrible. I just want to feel normal and be social again.",Do u have tightness in chest everyday all day ? I also have that problem especially when I try driving or if I haven’t eaten after 3 hours or so it’s terrible

The YouTube channel 'Bye Bye Panic' is also useful.

They all teach you to not fear the panic and anxiety but accept them (sounds crazy I know but it'll make sense). What you resist persists. The more you fight the more adrenaline your body will send you and the worse you feel. 

Thanks to the above, I don't fear the majority of physical symptoms anymore and, as such, I don't get as many of them now but they've morphed into mental symptoms and it's kind of a bitch but I'm working on it.

I hope that helps."
Anxiety flares up while trying to sleep!!,"If anyone is dealing with this please share some tips that helps you!! I have to keep my mind busy during the day and can never take naps or else at nighttime I cant sleep even if its short my mind will fight the sleepiness and keep me awake.
My mind is clear at the moment but my body is acting the same as when im overtaken by my worries or just thinking too deep its our existence so any help is appreciated even if its just a small tip ^^","No tips, but I'm lying in bed right now with the same issue. I feel like as soon as I get in bed the anxiety just really takes the spotlight in my mind."

They’ve helped me feel more relaxed and calm. I also use them to sleep better, helping me avoid waking up frequently during the night and making it easier to fall asleep. What I find most valuable is that, being natural, they are gentle on the body and the digestive system, which makes them easy to use as part of my routine. I don’t see a psychologist because my anxiety isn’t severe, but after discussing it with my doctor, I was advised to try this kind of product."
Feel like the worst mom/wife on Thanksgiving :-(,"I’m sure I’m not the only one, but holidays, like today, cause me great anxiety and the migraines that go along with it.  I really have no “reason” for it and have been working with a psychiatrist for a while now.  My family is wonderful, and try to accommodate my stress.  I try to hide it as my children are SO excited for Thanksgiving, Christmas and any other momentous event.  I, on the other hand, feel nervous, heart palpitations, headache and fatigue.  I don’t understand why and just try to accept it.  I will be struggling to get through today.  Anyone else feeling the same?",I have no kids but yes!  I promise you they will see it later how you gave them such a good holiday even if you have  bad anxiety!

Well, that's good for medication purposes, but what about therapy? You can gain great tools on how to deal with these events that trigger you. You can also get to the root cause of the anxiety, maybe removing it..... drugs won't do that.

Maybe try therapy between now and Christmas. I hope you find your answers and better days ahead."

I’ve had health challenges the last several months including a brain aneurysm which set off my panic disorder and agoraphobia that was previously under control. I was only able to last two hours at my in-laws and I felt like I broke my six year olds heart when I said we had to leave. I am currently off meds because of a prolonged QT interval and I’m breastfeeding so my options are limited.

Only people with anxiety will understand..,"that this is a disorder with peaks and valleys. The peaks & valleys may last an hour, a day, a week, a month or a year.

Wow, this is what life looks like hey. The contrast is that noticeable. ""Wow, I'm here, I'm present"" It may not last forever and tomorrow it could be different but right now I recognize the clarity.

Wondering what was wrong with me because anti depressants and therapy weren't making much of a difference.  At baseline I was at least mildly depressed.  

I was functional enough to work but that's it's.  Home and social life was rough to non existent. 

One month on the lowest dose of stimulants and my whole life has changed.  It's like the switch was flipped of hard mode.  Everything takes no to little effort and I wake up happy."

","I asked my psychiatrist ""what if my anxiety and depression are the symptoms not the disease?"". My son also is diagnosed with ADHD and we are waiting for an autism assessment for him. 
My Dr went over the ASRS symptom checklist with me.  He said to think about my childhood to now and to think about any coping skills I might be using for that symptom. 

Ie I rarely forget appointments because I immediately put them on my google calendar.  I also review my calendar frequently.  I am very distracted by noises or other sensory input.  As far as tasks go, I was constantly pep talking myself to start a task or part of a task. I bribe myself to complete tasks... Ie 5 mins of YouTube when x is done. I interrupt or try to finish other people's comments daily. I have a horrible time relaxing....even when it looks like I'm doing nothing.  My mind was constantly on the go with thoughts and worries.  I had hundreds of negative automatic thoughts an hour.  I was exhausted just dealing with those. 

Since medication my negative thoughts only pop up in stressful situations then go away.  I don't have to bribe myself or pep talk myself for most tasks.... Things just get done. I wake up happy now.... And my missing sex drive is back!  Life is much more peaceful.  I find myself reaching out to make plans with friends.  Its not the end of the world when plans change or cancel.  I'm much more easy going. I sing songs in my head now because my thoughts/ self talk is less. 

I've had years of therapy and tried to coach myself through these things but the mental energy it required killed my tank to be able to handle anything else. 

I'd rather live a shorter life on stimulants than live the way I was before.  I was just trying to survive the day.  Now I'm enjoying the day."

","There is a deep connection between anxiety and ADHD, OCD + autism spectrum largely because those disorders are typically found in people that are constantly thinking and can’t relax. I don’t think I have very many ADHD symptoms per se but I definitely believe I’m undiagnosed somewhere on the spectrum. I have trouble with fidgeting and certain physical habits, maintaining eye contact and I hyper-fixate & heavily research & emotionally invest in certain topics and become overly passionate about them. Maybe I’m just extremely analytical and meticulous. I definitely have signs of OCD. That said, I’m extremely social, surround myself with people whenever I can and I’m extremely outspoken and can mold around any personality so idk."

","Absolutely there is an intensity cycle. For me, my anxiety manifests itself as physical symptoms and causes me debilitating health anxiety. The only thing that seems to help is either frequent reassurance from health care that I’m not dying (not a healthy stimulation cycle in itself) or successfully convincing myself I’m not dying. That part is what I’m working on. 

I guess statistics are what helps me. “Look fuckstick you’re 29, healthy, your family genes are better than most and the only thing you’ve been diagnosed with so far is anxiety, you’ve been wrong about everything else to date. You’re not gonna be the rare person under 50 with debilitating health issues like MS or brain tumours” 

Last major cycle I went through was earlier in the spring for about 2 months while I was waiting for a ct scan for ice pick headaches. As soon as I got a negative result I was able to live my life in relative peace for another 6 months until life itself threw me shit coloured lemons and my anxiety started attacking me again but significantly worse. Here’s hoping I’m on my way out of it again, this time on my own accord. May pick up some meds to help me regulate."

I'm not a worrier and don't fixate on things that happen in my day to day life.  The only thing I worry about is my anxiety and if I'm having a heart attack or a stroke.  I'll be sitting here feeling perfectly fine then woosh, out of nowhere, anxiety washes over me. My stomach drops like I was just in a near miss accident, and I feel all this pressure in my head, dizzy, tightness in my chest, my heart starts racing, I feell like I want to claw my skin off to escape.  I will go days where I have this constant feeling of physical discomfort and I'm convinced something is wrong with me. Then it goes away for a blissful couple weeks and I feel like a normal person. 
I've had EKG'S, Echo's, CT scan, labs. Nothing is wrong besides my brain. It is very frustrating."

It's horrible. I had ECG's, ultrasounds, a head CT earlier this year. More labs than I can count. Been to the ER more times this year than I had in my whole life prior. Poked and prodded, I'm so over it but the symptoms persist. I was literally in today for a 5 year cardio checkup (dad's side has history of H&S issues, I don't have the genetic issue but doc sends me anyway) and he told me my heart was perfectly healthy. Blood pressure, heart rate is perfect, and later today I got chest pains so bad I clutched my chest in agony.

","Lots of health care professionals don’t understand. Many also get annoyed. I’m lucky enough to have had an absolutely brilliant doctor my whole life who knows when to test me to reassure me, and when to tell me he’s not worried about whatever I’m feeling because he knows I trust him. He has never been wrong. He is a powerful force in my life and I’m lucky to have him. 

All I know is a health care facility is the safest place for me when I feel off, even though I need to get out of this cycle of constant testing. It’s impacting my work life. 

Oddly enough when I’m drinking almost all of my physical symptoms take a leave of absence and then come back twice as intense the next day so it’s not worth it. I’ve always joked and said I wish I could live life 3 beers deep 24/7. Nowhere near blasted, just right at that moment you’re still completely present, aware and focused on what you’re doing but your shoulders start to drop and you loosen up, your mind just kinda floods with serotonin and your inhibitions & negative thoughts just fuck off for awhile.

Which medication should I take?,Hi i suffer with severe health anxiety depression and ocd. Tried numerous meds have recently come off of pristiq as I didint like way it made me feel. I have two options now of meds to take one of which is Mirtazapine and the other is Vortioxetine. I’m not sure which one I should take and would help me more as my anxiety is debilitating and stopping me from doing things and worrying about out everything. I speak to a psychiatrist and she recommended the Mirtazapine but when I seen my GP I mentioned I’m not keen on the side effects of Mirtazapine especially the weight gain and increased hunger as Iam quite fit and like exercising and playing sport to which I have not been able to do as much due to my anxiety crippling me but I don’t want the medication to make me want to stop exercising I want to feel like I can exercise and play sport still. Any suggestions on which would be more beneficial I’ve tried ssri and snri I think that’s maybe why psych suggested Mirtazapine 15mg at night. Much appreciated.,Have you tried Effexor?

Driving Anxiety ,"Hello! I (30M) got my drivers license two months ago and still have pretty bad anxiety when it comes to driving by myself and without an instructor. I thought it would get better overtime but seems every time I make a mistake I dwell on it and get more & more anxious the next time I'm behind the wheel.

I know the only way to gain confidence is to go on more drives however if anyone has any advice or something that helped them through their journey it would be much appreciated! 🙏","I used to have such bad driving anxiety when I first got my license but now I love to drive. I’m not sure where you live and how close you are to somewhere where you can drive on quiet rural roads, but I found that getting away from busy city driving and going into the suburbs or more rural areas where there are much less people on the road and just going for a leisurely drive really helped to make me enjoy the act of driving. I was able to put on some fun tunes and just enjoy going for a drive without worrying too much about traffic and other people around me."

I’ve been driving for 17 years now. I don’t have anxiety driving my personal car. I recently obtained my cdl and drive a tractor trailer. Some days are very nerve wracking and I’ve made several mistakes. Such as nearly killing a sign by not turning wide enough. Hit a curb and popped two trailer tires. I took that turn as wide as I could without using the left lane, the rules are completely different. With each experience I keep detailed notes and have bullet points stuck to the dash. Those notes are in my face and the biggest pointer I can give you is to take your time. Don’t let others influence your driving “emergency vehicles not included”. Don’t let others speed you up or slow you down. Drive how you feel comfortable. If you start to panic, use your flashers and pull over. We make the dumbest decisions when panicked. I have anxiety and know the feeling all too well. The racing heart and thoughts spell trouble when driving. Pull over in a safe place and let yourself calm down. 

I will leave you with a quote from my recent trainer. You can drive down a mountain slowly one hundred times, but you can only drive fast down a mountain once."

They’ve helped me feel more relaxed and calm. I also use them to sleep better, helping me avoid waking up frequently during the night and making it easier to fall asleep. What I find most valuable is that, being natural, they are gentle on the body and the digestive system, which makes them easy to use as part of my routine. I don’t see a psychologist because my anxiety isn’t severe, but after discussing it with my doctor, I was advised to try this kind of product."
I hate people:),"My mental health is fu***d up.
Basically i live in a hostel and the conditions here make me yuck everytime.
Now the thing is that i want to leave hostel on one condition that i will live alone but I'm not used to living alone and this shit scares me.Why living alone?
Because I'm fed up with people even my friends 🥲 i have no idea why this is happening. I JUST DON'T WANT ANYONE NEAR ME.
And I'm confused af. Leaving hostel and living alone don't know what to do. I even want a break from my college.
Help me out everyone suggest me something pls:)
","Yeah, I get this way too sometimes. Sometimes you just don’t wanna be around people. When things are going bad, and no one seems to be helping you, feels like they don’t care.

Usually, this is our inner psyche yelling at us. I’m sure your friends are still caring about you and your well-being. Unfortunately, I know a lot about tough love. Sometimes they think it’s for the best, or they just don’t wanna help.

Half my family basically said  “Nope.” When I became homeless for the first time in my life. Spent almost 2 years since that happened. I knew real quick who was and wasn’t my friend, or family. Took a long while, but I managed to figure myself out.

I hope this doesn’t get worse for you and you can actually live on your own. I would’ve loved to have a place to live on my own if you’re able to do it, then do it. Circumstances can always be worse, but at least you made the choice. So that means you have options, and you’re not just pushed against the wall.

Sorry if this sounds a little blunt, but I try to be as honest as possible."
Infection or my anxiety?,"I've suffered with anxiety my whole life. I'm unmedicated. 

6 years ago I dealt with a mysterious infection in my bladder and cervix that causes me 5 months of severe trauma from the medical system dismissing me as crazy. I ended up finding out about Ureaplasma/mycoplasma...despite testing negative I did the antibiotic treatment on my own and was cured. Got my life back, then didn't have sex for 5 years.

Then I met someone and I thought I met my soul mate. Long story short he was a covert narcissist and we broke up after 8 months. Soon after the breakup those familiar symptoms came back. My doctor tested me for Ureaplasma right away and I was positive. She got me 14 days doxy and I took it. My symptoms went away fairly fast. I was in the middle of moving and missed a dose here and there but still took them all in the end. 

All was well for a month, when all of a sudden symptoms returned. I immediately tested again for Ureaplasma/mycoplasma and was negative. Treated for yeast infection but it didn't relief symptoms. Retested again over a week later and still negative. Symptoms were raging at this point with vaginal burning, urethra and bladder burning, burning after urination. All my classic symptoms. I asked for clindamycin cream out of desperation which stopped the vaginal burning but not the urethra/bladder symptoms. I've done swabs, urine cultures, all negative. Went to the ER and was humiliated. Doctors think I'm crazy. I even ordered micro biom tests out of pocket and all negative.

At this point I've spiraled into a deep depression. Reliving the same  traumatic nightmare I dealt with 6 years ago. Symptoms got so bad I redid Ureaplasma treatment on my own. I'm still on it. Burning urethra and bladder symptoms have stopped but I still get some burning after urination vaginally. By anxiety lasts all day, and I've been stuck in tense flight/fight for weeks. Now my pelvis feels full and I can't hold much urine. I have to literally push it out. I have an appt with a specialist in January, and a pelvic floor therapist next week.  Until then I'm trying to convince myself that I'm going to be okay but I can't. 
I can't work. All I do is lay in bed a cry, and pee all day.  I am a single parent and can't even function to care for my son, he's spending the holiday week with my mom so I can try to get myself sorted mentally. 
I'm starting to think I'll never get better and I'm terrified. 

Could my anxiety and trauma from the past have sent me into a vicious pain and anxiety cycle? Obviously I'm curing some sort of infection as certain parts of the burning are now gone. 

Has anyone gone through anything similar? ",[removed]

But I know it’s my anxiety and like without thinking I like get this burst of energy for like a second ,"Yes, I still get them but they don't bother me anymore.

My anxiety was health related when it came on and I was super focused on my heart, and the flutters used to really freak me out. But after two years and clean heart checkups, I finally accepted that if something was truly wrong, it would have probably killed me or landed me in the hospital over that time.

It didn't, so I just learned to sit with the sensations when they happen and let them pass. And the more I did that, the less the palpitations happen."

Definitely get a clean bill of health from a cardiologist. Insist  they do all the necessary tests and then some. If you get a clean bill of health, believe them. It’s quite common to get all sorts of symptoms with anxiety. They did a huge, long term study a few years back. Not one person had a heart attack much less died from anxiety or even fainted. I got the flutters many many times. I’m still here 38 years later. All that worry for nothing. I tried tending to my health and then my mental health looking for a solution to no avail. It was a cognitive behavioral problem all along. If this indeed psychosomatic, you are safe. Proceed with confidence. Don’t let this hold you back."

Like a random false alarm going off. I get them too - feels like your heart does a little flip for no reason. Usually harmless but worth mentioning to your doctor if it bothers you.

I think sometimes it's just muscles spasming because it feels similar in places like my stomach or other muscles when they spasm Or flutter. Or sometimes it's gas escaping my esophagus. 

The anxious me wants to THINK it's heart related, and there's a brief moment of anxiety, but the intellectual me understands that actual heart issues would be much more intense. The more I've learned to ignore them the less they occur."

Edit: just to be clear, we shouldn’t use medical information to freak people out in the anxiety sub. Saying something is wrong with their heart and denying that heart palpitations are a thing is harmful misinformation. Most palps are harmless and do not involve dysfunction of the heart."
Does anyone else get a flutter sensation in their chest sometimes?,Idk why sometimes I get like this fluttering sensation almost like I’m excited? But I know it’s my anxiety and like without thinking I like get this burst of energy for like a second ,"I never said it involved dysfunction of the heart or denied that palps are a thing, as I clearly stated they are and are mostly benign. I DO think it’s harmful to tell someone not to seek medical help though and get it looked at regardless, even if just to calm the anxiety that palps create. Most are ectopic heartbeats and it IS the heart, but isn’t doing any damage to the heart. They are benign and due to anxiety. OP and anyone feeling palpitations should 100% see a cardiologist to rule out anything else. 🤷‍♀️ not sure why you disagree with that.

  
eta lol at either blocking me, or deleting your comments all together. Just so others know, my regular doctor said that some heart conditions cause anxiety, so it’s always good to still get checked out and be sure it’s all okay. Plenty of heart issues are treatable and are not a death sentence!"
I feel like I've done all the anxiety things,"Per my past therapists' recommendations for anxiety I do yoga in the morning for 15 minutes, about a total of 20 minutes of breathing exercises/meditation throughout the day, I make sure not to ruminate on negative thoughts, I journal each night, I have lists for habits and routines, I walk about three miles every day and make sure I'm eating an appropriate amount of fruits and vegetables. I do have too much sugar and I'm trying my best to get 8-10 hours of sleep a night but it's hard because my heart is still racing all the time.

Of course sometimes we need to try and address the anxiety - to calm it with supplements, breath work, therapy, exercise, tea, all the stuff. But sometimes the most important thing we can do is simply dive into our day, and try to leave the anxiety behind. Much easier said than done. But sometimes we have to choose not to let the anxiety have a seat at the table. To spend time with friends. Laughing. Singing. It all helps relegate the anxiety to its appropriate seat - not to let it rule the whole conversation in my mind.

Again, I’m saying this as someone still dealing with anxiety daily to varying degrees. Some days I do pretty good at getting anxiety to function in its right role and I feel almost normal again like I used to. Other days it feels like it’s all I can do to keep it somewhat managed. But I have to believe that with continued care, prayer, and perhaps most importantly, time, it will get better."
I feel like I've done all the anxiety things,"Per my past therapists' recommendations for anxiety I do yoga in the morning for 15 minutes, about a total of 20 minutes of breathing exercises/meditation throughout the day, I make sure not to ruminate on negative thoughts, I journal each night, I have lists for habits and routines, I walk about three miles every day and make sure I'm eating an appropriate amount of fruits and vegetables. I do have too much sugar and I'm trying my best to get 8-10 hours of sleep a night but it's hard because my heart is still racing all the time.

I have no idea what else to do for anxiety. I feel like I've done everything. It's at the point where I'm not even sure what I'm worried about anymore because I've thought myself out of everything I could be worried about, I just know that I'm worried. I feel like I don't even exist as a person anymore, just a ball of worry. And people keep giving me the same tips and say ""Oh well 20 minutes of meditation isn't enough? Try 30. Try 45. Try an hour."" I don't have this much time to dedicate towards making myself not worried!

My parents say this level of effort is normal but we have anxiety running in our family. Is it normal? Do most people spend this much time trying not to be worried and still end up worried? Is there something that I'm missing that I should be doing?","Omg I just started getting really bad vertigo too, it’s so bad !"

Need advice,"Had a couple panic attacks these past two weeks. The past three days I've been have the shakes and a lot of anxiety. Been super stressed these past couple weeks. Yesterday I woke to having to vomit and super dizzy and light headed. The day before that, I noticed when trying to eat, my head would hurt on both sides of my temple. Went to the doctor did EKGs, blood sugar, etc. She said I was extremely healthy. Today I woke up okay again, except throughout the day I began having this terrible headache. I can't clench my jaw without it hurting. I'm sensitive to light. The pain is on both sides of my head (temple area). I need to vomit. I feel like I'm not anxious. The pain is unbearable. ","These are all anxiety symptoms, and I know that it feels SO SO real, but I promise you, this is classic anxiety. If the doctor told you that you were extremely healthy, then I would trust them. I know it’s hard not to, hell I had a panic attack just last night. But I got in bed, slept it off, and just kept moving. It sucks so bad, and I know it feels so real and that it will never stop, but this too shall pass. Please try to just constantly remind yourself that it is all anxiety. Anxiety tricks your brain and body into thinking it’s something out to kill you, but I promise you will wake up tomorrow. If you need to vent please don’t hesitate to reach out."
how can I stench anxious thoughts?," I'm a teen, but suffer from anxiety throughout my whole life. From very young age, I remember myself very shy in new companies, even nervous.

 I'm not sure why I had such trouble, but I still have this problem. I have hobbies, things I'd like to make, but if I'm making something wrong - I won't ever try again. Because as soon as I'm letting my mind flow, my head fills with anxious thoughts that make me cry. Anxiety makes me feels useless and helpless.

 Sometimes I don't do my homework because of spending all the time in my phone. But the thing that pulls me out is worries about my future:
 A year ago I was in new country, new school, and I didn't knew language because of circumstances. Of course I didn't have any friends. I thought all the bad things was because the school was bad.

Need help for long distance partner w/ severe anxiety attacks,"TW: Suicide/ideation

Urgent help needed for long distance partner w/ painful anxiety attacks 

Need urgent help for my partner. We’re long distance (both in medical school, but she’s outside the US). She has doctors appts set up for when her semester ends and she’s back in the US for breaks (~3 weeks) but I need help helping her until then. 

Both of us are autistic. I’ve had a panic disorder for over a decade, she’s had depression for about as long. I like to think I’ve built up a good repertoire of coping mechanisms for panic attacks, but these past few days have been out of my depth. 

It seems like a combination of severe stress and autistic meltdown. She’s severely sleep deprived bc her anxiety won’t let her sleep until she passes out tense every night and only manages 3-4hrs of sleep. Her muscles and joints burn constantly from the tension and last night she said every inch of her skin felt like it was burning, she said it was agonizing. Usually me calling and her hearing my voice helps, but she’s so overstimulated she won’t let me call. She has a friend that looks after her and makes sure she eats at school, but once she’s home alone it’s terrifying. She will be physically paralyzed for hours and in sm pain from the anxiety. 

We’ve tried breathing techniques, distraction, me calling and rambling w/o her having to respond back, somatic input (arm squeezes, vagus nerve stimulation with heating pad), showers (make things WAY worse), talking things out, attempting to reframe thinking. 

We can sometimes get an hour or so of reprieve where we can talk normally. We play a writing game together and sometimes can get an exchange or two through that which is my sign she’s doing okay. But she’s been in so much pain for days now. 

TW: suicide/ideation
She has a plan. Won’t let me know what it is. She texted me the other day trying to get me to tell her what personal items of hers I want if she does do it. She’s promised me she’ll always call if she’s close and I’ve been able to help her before, but I’m running out of things to say other than “I know you’re in pain, I’m right here,” (she doesn’t like when I say I’m sorry). I used to feel confident it was just her depression talking, and she’d always reassure me that she didn’t actually see it as an option, but I don’t think that’s true anymore. I’m really worried if I don’t find a way to help her with the physical pain she’s in something bad will happen. 

Her family life is rough. I’m not sure if I should tell her mother or not— she’s honestly a terrifying woman and told my partner if she fails a class/drops out of school, she’s not welcome back home. But every once in a while she’ll help with mental health stuff (made my partner the doc appt for when she gets back). Medical care where she is is incredibly minimal and she has past medical trauma that makes encouraging her to go to hospital extremely difficult. 

I don’t know what to do. I can’t go to her— I don’t have my passport (in the process of getting it, but I’m also in med school). I can say with full confidence my partner is the love of my life. Not being able to be there and hold her and help her calm down is agonizing. I need help helping her, please. ","I’ve used CBD oils with concentrations ranging from 10% to 30% from the brand Eusphera during moments of anxiety or stress. They’ve helped me feel more relaxed and calm. I also use them to sleep better, helping me avoid waking up frequently during the night and making it easier to fall asleep.

I don’t see a psychologist because my anxiety isn’t severe, but after discussing it with my doctor, I was advised to try this kind of product."
Hypochondria/OCD,"Over the last 2 weeks I have convinced myself I have a hernia in my belly button. After 3 visits to different doctors, all confirming the bump I feel is a fat deposit/cyst, i always begin to doubt the doctor and I cannot stop feeling the bump. My belly button has cuts, is swollen and red.

I have a baby due in a few days and am desperate for coping techniques that have worked for others. I started medication 1 week ago.

I have had health anxiety since I was 12 but this is the most debilitating it’s been.","Hello, I recovered from extreme hypochondria. It's all about abstaining from reassurance seeking behavior. So checking your symptoms, googling, asking people and going to doctors a lot. Doing any of that keeps your tolerance of uncertainty low, which is the core of the issue. If you stop with that, you slowly become more comfortable with uncertainty, leading to less of this anxiety. 

And medication could help a lot. To me it made very big difference and made it easier to stay away from reassurance seeking."
Spiraling,"Hey everyone. 46F here diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder about 9 years ago. On various medications for anxiety and depression, and recently started seeing a psychologist, whom I really like. However, lately (past several months) my anxiety has been out of control. I am particularly obsessed with finances, and anxious about money, debt (which we really don't hacer a ton of), but worrying about a financial emergency that will devestate us (despite having a fairly ok emergency fund). I also worry about my stepkids and any potential issues that may arise in the future between my partner and his ex. I catastrophize the littlest things. I almost make up scenarios that haven't happened, and have no idea why or how to stop it. I think my therapist and I are still in the unpackimg phase, as I haven't really gotten advice yet. I just want everything to stop and for my mind and thoughts to quiet down. I never used to be like this, and I'm sure my perimenopause is just exacerbating things. My partner is loving and supportive, but really doesn't understand. He thinks it's just a switch I shoukd be able to turn off. I wish it was that easy. Does anyone else feel this way? I feel so alone and helpless and broken, and like I'll feel this way until I die. ","i totally get the feeling of spiraling... i started using the Inner Journey app last month and it really helps with managing anxiety. it has guided meditations and daily reflections that can help quiet your mind. give it a try, it might help u find some balance."
Oh my god help thanksgiving I’m so scared,I am freaking out in my room to go see my family for thanksgiving I literally cant handle it my heart is so uncomfortable right now I don’t know what to do bc I’m soon going to be told to come down or else oh my god,"First, forgive yourself.

Let’s try to settle that heart rate friend, breathe in 4 seconds, hold 4 seconds, out 4 seconds, hold 4 seconds, repeat.

Also try to ground yourself. Pick 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell.

Everything will be okay, before you know it tomorrow will come"

racing thoughts but you don’t feel anxious?,I don’t feel anxious but the racing thoughts are making me panic? if that makes sense? anyone else get this?,"That happens to me and I can’t figure out why that’s happening! Like, I have several tabs open in my mind but I don’t feel anxious about them, if anything I feel like I need to hurry up and manage each tab."
Experience with Klonopin/Clonazepam 2mg. ,"My doctor —a PCP— prescribed me 10 mg of Klonopin/Clonazepam daily as needed. I don't know how to feel about this. I feel like it's too excessive. I'm diagnosed with GAD and MDD. I have tried a few medications before, but none of them worked. —Clomipramine/Anafranil 175 mg for 7 months.— Then, —Quetiapine for a short period of time, then I had to discontinue the treatment because it gave some skin lesions, my body and face were all red, covered in painful patches, swollen lips...—
I've tried —Sertraline before, but for an unknown  reason it gives uncontrollable diarrhea.— (I'm sorry if that's TMI.)
I took 10 mg of Klonopin last night as prescribed, and today I woke up feeling lethargic/slow, like I'm intoxicated — loss of balance, can really keep my eyes open, feeling sleepy.— I will say that Klonopin helped me manage my physiological issues.  (Shaking uncontrollably, shivering, feeling frozen in place, stuttering,  unable to speak sometimes, excessive sweating, the vomiting, and diarrhea.), but surprisingly, I'm still experiencing the same anxious thoughts. I'm confused right now. Why is still happening? By the way, I have **EXTREME ANXIETY** just even the thought of leaving my residence makes me want to throw up; sometimes it's so bad that I poop my pants. I'm sorry for being so explicit like that. I'm just looking for some help. I'm 26 years old I have nothing going on, for an entire decade I didn't leave my house, from ages 16 to 26. The only time I left my residence —July 26th 2024— was to attend my mom's funeral 4 months ago. I barely remember anything; I was inebriated. But that's pretty much it; not really sure of what I'm looking for here. I just wish that there were a way that I could live my life peacefully... I'm losing hope. I think about suic*de quite often, quite frequently. But truthfully, I don't want to do that. I just want to live my life as a regular individual. There are so many things in my  life that I never had the chance to experience. Not asking for anything extravagant, Inwant to be happy, I want to make friends, go out, meet new people, have sex, eat tons of different foods, experience different cultures —if possible— find me a partner, possibly start a family... I'm not asking for anything unrealistic. 
",10 mg or 2mg? I will say those are both high starting doses to begin. I only take 0.25 mg every now and then if it’s really bad and that makes me a bit out there so I couldn’t imagine a higher dose. If you *need* to take it I’d definitely ask for a lower dose

",Take it as needed. I only take it when I can’t handle my anxiety and I’m about to have a panic attack. When I do take it I take only take 0.25-0.5mg. I usually just bite into half of one or whatever. Give it 30 minutes at most and then I’m completely calm. If you need something to help through everyday I would seriously think about looking for a different medication. This shit is extremely addictive and incredibly hard to stop taking

They ran all sorts of tests for my heart, for my other functions, lots of blood drawn, all came back without issue.

Still was getting them after the hospital so sleep wasn’t happening for a while. 

Changed my diet to cut I out salt and upped my activity more.  Lost 30lbs and my general BP dropped to safer levels…. But still would have panics.

Eventually after 2 specialist and two appts with my PCP, they prescribed me 15 pills of Xanax for emergencies.  That shit worked like a charm, but I don’t take it unless it’s bad, so I still have to work through.

Now I still get panics but not as bad.  I did end up going to the ER one more time but the panic and Bp lowered while I was there so they discharged me. 

Day at a time.  It’s just learning how to manage it.  But the silver lining is I got my health a bit better (people noticed the weight loss) and I understand my body a bit more."

The high turned into a massive panic attack, which I’ve never had before and I went home and tried to relax but nothing was helping..felt like I was genuinely dying. I woke up my mom and we ended up calling an ambulance.

They took me right into Emergency and hooked me a up to an ECG, did some tests, gave me meds through an IV. Nothing was working to calm me down, and the amount of people and staff looking in at me was only making it worse. They eventually moved me into a trauma room because my heart was beating so fast for so long that it started beating irregularly.

Now I have a bunch of doctors and nurses standing around me looking at my vitals and back at me etc, they gave me a pill under my tongue (to knock me out) and told me that they were going to use a defibrillator to try and put my heart back in normal rhythm. It did its job and I came to a couple hours later. Ever since then I’ve struggled with major anxiety and cardio phobia.

It became so bad I called the ambulance to take me to the hospital.  When they arrived, they seemed really concerned. My heart rate was 200 bpm.  They told me to bear down and when I got to the hospital, they did an EKG and checked me out.  Told me I was having a severe panic attack and gave me a bag to breathe in.  I went home and for days I felt terrible.  Eventually I got better, but I still don’t know why my heart beats that fast when I have a panic attack.  They eventually gave me a beta blocker so when I had a panic attack, my heart doesn’t beat that fast.    That’s not my worst panic attack just when I started to have them more.  I’ve gone a whole year having panic attacks before.  You’re going to be OK. The sooner you can convince yourself of that the less of them you will have… It’s normal to have adrenaline rushes. It’s normal for your hormones to be messed up. It’s normal to get vertigo. It’s normal to have a bunch of things happen and if you can just say that’s a side effect of anxiety it’ll end sooner.

Managed to get the attention of a security guard and told him I was having a heart attack so of course he rushed off to call an ambulance whilst someone else claimed me down... They obviously realised it was a panic attack and not a heart attack and I went home early and was off for a week.

I can’t even drink caffeine. I started feeling a little weird about one hour later. I felt my stomach drop, heart pounding, and I completely disassociated. It’s like I was someone else. This started around 4PM. At 2AM it just got worse and worse. My heart literally felt like it was exploding and I was nearly hallucinating from the rapid fire intrusive thoughts. I had to wake my dad up to take me to the hospital and my heart rate was 180. They gave me zero medication and sent me home. I had a rolling panic attack that went on for 2 weeks. All day and all night long. It would ween off and then another one would start minutes later. It was literally one of the worst things that I’ve ever experienced. I now know that my panic attack was feeding off the fear I had, because I didn’t know what was happening to me and it just kept re triggering it for weeks on end.

I didn't call 911, I instead called my sister and told her everything as I began crying. She lived an hour away and showed up in 15 minutes with a state trooper and EMT's. 

I fell out of my truck because at this point my whole body felt like it was tearing itself apart. Finally after standing back up i got brought to the ambulance and rushed to an Emergency Room where I immediately passed out

Woke up 3 hours later with a doctor looking very concerned. He said he's never seen an anxiety attack cripple someone to the point of fainting like I did. We then for the next 2 hours discussed EVERYTHING from home life, to work, friends etc. And finally he said that my anxiety came from how often and how long I work.

I'm not sure if this will be helpful, but I did get out of the situation that caused mine. 

I had to stop my (usually very chill) 6 foot 2 ex navy father from physically harming my 4 foot 7 drunk, vulnerable mother, who was in the depths of alcohol abuse. I don't place blame on him because he hadn't slept in two days because of his work schedule and she refused to stop drinking. He snapped. 

Anyway, I'm 5 foot 7 (F) and fairly fit, and basically had to get between the two of them, push him away from her, and stand my ground. I threatened to call the police if he laid another hand on either of us. He immediately left with his work car and didn't come back for three or four hours, during which I left multiple voicemails on his phone and told him that he needed to come back and make the situation right, because I wasn't going to. He did come back by morning. 

The panic attack I had lasted for about six hours, during which I had to calm myself down and then take care of my mother, who was fairly suicidal at that point and delirious. I got no sleep that night and somehow managed to make it to work at 9am the next day. This was just another incident in a long string of them, so it was by no means my first panic attack or my longest. 

My parents are better now and they're healing, slowly. I moved out two years after that incident and have been in therapy since. I was mid twenties at the time. 

Whatever you're going through, you can get through it, OP. Its going to be hell for a while and it's going to suck. But you can make it through. Be brave. I know it's hard."
Your worst panic attack?,"Can somebody share stories about your worst panic attacks? I'm in bad place rn after recent panic attack, I want to be reassured by stories of others.","All through the 90’s I had thousands of panic attacks. 3 decades later, I’m still here. I’m not afraid any more. 

Don’t measure your success by whether or not you get symptoms. It’s a habit your body got into. 

As you gradually disregard it, your body will catch on and you will have fewer and fewer panic attacks. 

Don’t fight it. The less you worry about it, the less you try to get rid of it or try to figure it out, the better. 

Don’t try to convince yourself, be convinced. You decide what you truly believe no matter what you feel or what thoughts pop in your mind. 

If you can’t avoid feeling worried when you have a panic attack, don’t worry about it the rest of the time and you will see results. 

Despite your best efforts you will have relapses. This is entirely normal as it wears out. 

Don’t treat it like a physical illness and try not to associate it with other sources of anxiety in your life. These other sources of anxiety are related, therapy is important, but these two different issues aren’t one and the same. More than the issues that cause you anxiety in your life, this is caused by your focusing too much on your body. 

You are safe.

I was playing the crash bandicoot remake that came out 6 years ago. The track was extremely hard. I spend like 10 hours to complete in. It was stressful. Then I started getting anxious, which turned into a fullblown panic attack. I had no idea why i was anxious (looking back i knew it was because of weed, but didn't wanna acknowledge it at that point)

I started breathing very fast, panicking. Was so geared up. I took my moms car (after asking of course) driving to my best friends house (who had struggled with anxiety for many years). It was so cold outside, i couldn't see out the windows, so just made a little whole i could see out of

When I came to him i was just a complete mess. Couldn't calm down or stop crying. It felt like my world was falling apart and i had nothing even to be anxious about. I just talked a lot. He told me to calm down and it wasn't dangerous and will pass again, then we went for a walk. He was very supportive. After about 1 - 1,5 hour it was gone

My partner woke me up because I wasn’t “breathing right,” still half asleep realized I was hyperventilating, then started panicking because of the breathing. Took me a solid 5 minutes to breathe normally. Once I thought I was okay, my ears started ringing, I got a rush of adrenaline and got drenched in sweat in a matter of seconds.

Nurses made me panic more by saying the heart rate shouldn't be so high, etc etc. Took my ECG. Then asked me to wait outside. I was sleeping with my head on my mother's lap, thinking I am going to die soon. The doctor was talking to some other patient, making some pun statements and here I am panicking. Then when my turn came, the doctor said there is nothing wrong in ECG and asked me to calm down. And just like that in few seconds, I felt all normal."

I had been anxious the entire day so it all just came crashing down when it came to night time, i couldn’t sleep and i was up almost all night, every time i tried to go to sleep i would be shaken awake by my own body. 
I needed to vomit but i couldn’t, I thought i was dying so i almost called 911, but i ended up not doing that and i just started researching everything to try and calm down. Looking through videos on how calm down just absolutely everything i could think of i was researching. 

This lasted all night, in the end i stripped naked because of how hot i was but it didn’t help, i stopped trying ti fall asleep and just gave in to the fact that my body couldn’t rest. 
I let everything happen and i started to calm down as the sun rose. The sound of birds and cars going past early in the morning helped a lot. 
My body had gone through so much stress due to the shaking that i couldn’t stand properly and everything ached, i still felt like i needed to throw up but alas, i couldn’t. 

Still one of the most traumatic experiences i’ve ever had"

I tried to calm down at first (I live alone but with a neighbor upstairs), but then it got worse and panic took over, my body was paralyzed, I was on my bed and couldn't I couldn't move my legs or anything. 

I had to drag myself on the ground, and my hands couldn't grab anything, not even my phone to call for help. I managed with all my strength to open my door (unlocking really took me a while), and ring my neighbor's bell, he welcomed me and helped me even though my legs were no longer holding me up; really my motor skills were at zero.

He called my parents that came, and I slowly regaigned all of my body abillities. But it was really traumatising for me; it happened to me again some month later, and I was more ready to face my fear of vomiting. 

Since this story I didn't throwed up, but I think I'll be more ready to face it when it'll happend.

There is a large hill to climb out of town with suicide lanes.  I had never had a Red Bull and was in need of a recharge so stopped and got one.  I was pretty amped on the hill climb and out of nowhere people started passing in the suicide lane - I was completely freaked out.  My heart was racing as I got to the top and seemed to continue as I made my way to Cortez.  The drive from Cortez to Monticello was uneventful but I was feeling very weird - slurring my words and very antsy.  I got to Monticello and was in a (now known) full blown panic attack but at the time thought it was a heart attack or stroke.  I stopped at Church Rock to get some air.  I met this guy checking out the super cool rock formation and we started chatting.  I could barely make a sentence.  My body was vibrating.  My hands shaking.  Could barely breathe.  He kept looking at me like I was drunk or high or something.  I realized this and made an excuse to leave.  I made it to Moab and kept on driving to Green River where I found a hotel.  I thought I was going to die and turned on the AC, cut out the lights, and dug into the bed at 4PM.  Woke up next day just fine and continued on my way.  First panic attack - and it was the worst I’ve ever had.

I’ve never had another Red Bull but lots of panic attacks since."

I honestly thought I was dying, and went through it until I got home, then had this intense impending sense of doom, hyperventilated on the phone to my mum (I'm F30) and said my goodbyes because I was convinced I'd die in my sleep.

Definitely the worst I have ever had. But I made it out the other side, decidedly less bloated and tired, but nothing went wrong, I didn't die, and the fear was honestly the worst part of it all. 

I've been working on my anxiety for over 5 years, but it really peaked last year, and a year later with some serious effort on my part to work with my therapist, I'm happy to say I've not had a serious panic attack in 4 months.

My most recent “panic episode” started in November 2023. I was watching my siblings over the weekend as I still live at home (partially due to my panic disorder). I was watching YouTube when suddenly everything around me started to zoom out. I felt completely and utterly unreal. I felt like I was floating or not even able to comprehend anything around me. Now I know I was experiencing derealization/depersonalization. It was during the night so I couldn’t call my parents as I didn’t want to wake them up. I was seriously contemplating waking my sister up to take me to the ER. That started a huge depersonalization episode and fear that’s lasted about a year now. Luckily I’ve gotten quite better and am able to have a job and do school full time. 

The July of that same year I had an extreme panic attack where I felt like I was choking and couldn’t breathe. I genuinely was accepting the fact I was going to die. It lasted for over 7 hours. I was just hyperventilating and gasping while sobbing for hours. After that I had multiple attacks a day over the same thing. That ended up in me feeling like I was unable to eat solid food for months. It got to the point I had to get my esophagus stretched to give me some peace of mind. It finally passed and I can eat now! 

It gets better 💙💙💙"

It was my first one. I was 16 and had been up all night on a Friday and randomly came to terms with my own mortality and really started thinking about it and the fact that I have zero control over it and I started spiraling over the course of 2 days. 
It was all I could think about, I didn’t sleep, I kept myself awake with large amounts of coffee (definitely wasn’t helping my case lol). I was in the living room with my mom and then I suddenly got that feeling of impending doom, I couldn’t breathe, I had tunnel vision to the point that I could barely see anything, I was crying hysterically, all that good stuff that comes with panic attacks and due to what I had been fixating on, it continued to get worse because I convinced myself that I was dying due to exhaustion or caffeine poisoning or something. 
Luckily, my mom knew exactly what was going on because she has a history of anxiety and panic attacks and helped me get through it, but it was just so intense and horrifying that i genuinely think it traumatized me. 
This was 10 years ago and I was never really the same after and I lived in constant fear of another panic attack. I ended up getting diagnosed with panic disorder and other anxiety disorders, as well as OCD, and I’ve unfortunately been on klonopin for 2 years now because my anxiety became too much for me to function properly. 
On the bright side, I did find a wonderful therapist, I’ve become more comfortable with talking and thinking about death without panicking, and I’m slowly tapering off my medication, so at least there’s that. 
Anxiety and anything that comes along with it is a curse I would never wish upon anyone, but it can get better. I never thought it would, but I’m slowly making progress."

The most randomly bad one was before a work zoom call with my team. I was working from home as normal, hadn’t felt any increased anxiety but I had a team call at around 10am that I had to briefly speak on.
Around 9.30am I randomly started feeling the panic sensation rising up because I knew I had this call. It was not at all an important call, but for some reason my body went into full panic. My heart rate was going nuts, my mouth and hands were going numb, and I felt like I was fully losing control. I started doing jumping jacks to try and get some of the adrenaline out but it didn’t help. I remember just pacing around almost physically pulling my hair out from pure fear, dry heaving and having derealisation. 
I got on the call and faked a bad cough and told my colleagues I was feeling really unwell. My manager messaged me saying I could take the rest of the day off as I was clearly coming down with something (lol yeah, coming down with a panic attack!). Weirdly, despite getting to leave the call and also stop working, this only made the panic attack even worse and it fully peaked after this. I had to turn all the lights off in my bedroom and lie down listening to a meditation but I felt like I was losing my mind. I remember calling my parents and trying to explain that I was going insane and they were like “eh?” and didn’t understand. 
I called my GP and managed to get a same-day telephone appointment, but I live in the UK and they won’t prescribe benzos here even for situations like mine where I was trapped in this never ending panic attack. I then resorted to drinking my housemate’s vodka in the hope it would mellow me out a bit so I could at least leave my flat. Needless to say that made me feel even worse. It took days to feel “normal” but I eventually did. It was literally so random, but work meetings/zoom calls are a huge trigger for me in general for some reason."

I was panicking already cause I was scared I was gonna faint and I didn’t eat much earlier. They saw me already visibly panicking and must have thought “oh yeah, this is definitely the best time to say you will DIE if you don’t eat. You’ll get sent to a hospital and D I E.” 

Thank you doctors for saying that because it sent me into a spiral and my legs, arms, and side of my face to my ears started to tingle and go completely numb. My blood pressure was absolutely insane, definitely the highest it’s ever been. I lost color in my face, I was hyperventilating, the room started to have a weird grey/yellowish color to it, my whole body was cold and clammy, I thought I was absolutely going to pass out which made me panic even more (I actually didn’t pass out which helped me get over my fear somewhat. It made me realize that it’s gonna take a lot more for me to pass out), I just laid on the table absolutely frozen with fear and the only thing that helped was for my mom hug me and for me to feel the weight of her and her own heartbeat and close my eyes. Doctor didn’t get any help or comfort me and just left the room. 

Needless to say I definitely will never go to that doctor again if I can help it."

Went to the ER and they confirmed it was a panic attack in reaction to fainting. I’ve never had one as bad since, but when I do get one it feels like everything is closing in around me, I’ll get soreness in chest and shoulders, feel hot then cold back and forth, lot of stiffness in body too.

I had to up my dosage of Lexapro because I hadn’t had a worse panic attack then that in a very long time.

That night I was in a tent with my friend that had a see through panel to see outside. I was hallucinating and every time I would see something scary outside like a monster or demon or something it would cause extreme panic. I'd already drank all my alcohol and used up the benzos I'd brought prior to this and was completely sober. 


I was shaking uncontrollably, sobbing, hyperventilating, screaming, the works. It took a good hour or two to calm me down. Luckily my friend was able to keep me distracted with this game we play where he describes a Pokémon and I have to name it and it's evolutionary line. That keeps my rational mind going enough to try to distract me from the panic.


Close second to this incident was an international plane flight that lasted 11 hours that had me shaking and sobbing uncontrollably for an hour. All the poor flight attendants could do was bring me cold water to help. I also threw up in the bathroom sink and toilet and there's not enough water on an airplane in those things to wash it out so I had to track down a flight attendant and admit what I'd done.

I was sick with something, like body aches and fever, but nothing too serious. It had been going on for a few days, until my mom kept insisting that I go to the doctor to see if I was okay or not. I was home alone, my husband hadn’t arrived yet, and my mom wasn’t home either. “I had had several panic attacks and anxiety issues before, but it had been a while since I had any, and nothing as intense as these two.” Anyway, going back, I was literally just standing there, and with these constant calls from my mom, I started to get worried, and literally, my heart started pounding hard, and my left arm began to hurt. I thought I was having a heart attack. I called my husband but couldn’t reach him, so I had to drag myself to the neighbor’s house. She took me to her place, and after calling my parents and husband, they carried me to the car to take me to the hospital, where they identified it as a panic attack. I took some medication and felt better.

That same week, I had to go with my family to the mall to take Christmas photos. On the way there, while I was in the car, I started to feel very strange, like my body was disconnected. It wasn’t like depersonalization; it was more like the car, the movement of the car, everything bothered me in a harsh way, and I started to get very irritated. I don’t even know if this can be considered a panic attack or a psychosis episode because I was so distressed. It felt like some kind of spirit had entered my body, so I ended up stopping at my grandmother’s house. I took deep breaths for a few hours, but on the way back, it was worse. I couldn’t let anyone touch me; I was totally stiff. I couldn’t sit still; I wanted to stretch. When I got to my mom’s house, I couldn’t lie down. I paced the room for hours, feeling restless. It was a kind of unease that I still can’t explain to this day. I didn’t experience dizziness, headaches, or the racing heart I usually have. I literally just had this intense restlessness that I can’t even describe. After that, I started having panic attacks almost daily."

Then my mouth went numb, hands went numb, chest felt numb and i was convinced i was going to pass out or die. I was screaming at everyone to call an ambulance because i didn’t know what was going on. I was trying to ground myself by breathing which did help a little because it slowed down my heart. I put some cold ice thing on my neck because my mom said it would help (it did) and after 30 minutes i was less panicked and straight up exhausted. That was one of the worst panic attacks because i have this insanely bad fear of passing out lol"

My coworkers understood though. They checked in with me. Told me it was going to be okay. And it was okay.

To get through the panic attack: it’s fucking hard but control your breathing and slow it down. I pretend I’m blowing a big bubble. I like to run water on my hands to ground myself. I also upped my therapy and started ECT. Please reach out to medical professionals. You can feel better and it won’t always feel like this."

The panic came with severe physical symptoms. I ran to the bathroom and could not stop having crampy explosive diarrhea in the airport bathroom, with the adrenaline and I felt like I was going to vomit at the same time. I had panic hives all over my chest and neck. I was almost in tears. My husband texting me from the gate “they’re doing last call you’re going to get left” as my parents and brother were on the plane. I completely emptied my entire body into that toilet and ran out at the last second, they closed the doors behind me. I sat still as a statue the entire flight feeling like I was dying, I didn’t eat or drink a thing because I kept having that impending doom feeling where I just wanted to get up and run away. Got off the plane and had a low blood sugar episode because I never ate after that bathroom situation at the gate. It was rough. Probably one of the worst."

I'm in bad place rn after recent panic attack, I want to be reassured by stories of others.","the longest panic attack i’ve had that eventually led me to go to a psychiatrist (after years of “only” therapy and seek to start medications). May 2019. For basically the whole month I was in a constant state of pure and utter panic, I didn’t work at the time so I was home all day every day. Couldn’t leave the house even if I wanted to, couldn’t sleep for more than an hour or two. Had to go back to sleep in my mom’s bed with her (dad slept in my bed) because it was the only way to give me at least these 2 hours of rest. Couldn’t eat. Felt like I was losing my mind, wanted to crawl out my body. I started to contemplate sui**** because I thought everything, even d*ath would’ve been less painful than what I was living through any minute of my life, wanted to self harm just so the physical pain could’ve taken away my “mental” pain even for some hours, didn’t do it cause I wouldn’t have known how to explain to my parents how I broke my hand or whatever else. More than one time I begged my mom to call an ambulance so they could sedate me or even put me in a induced coma so I could turn off my brain. It lasted for around 3 weekish before I saw for the first time a psychiatrist who immediately gave me xanax (and I think citalopram too? Can’t remember but it was two meds). First time I took xanax I slept for basically a whole day. Now I’m infinitely better (with my ups and downs but so does everyone else) but I will never forget the utter despair, sadness, panic, anxiety, dread that I felt that month. My parents were kinda my rocks and I don’t know where I would’ve been without them, or if I would be here at all! The human body and mind can pretty much survive everything. It can and will get better!!"

My worst as of those months, I was hanging out with a friend on a bench and suddenly got confused and everything suddenly looked different. I could not continue our conversation because when I tried to talk I could barely get words out because I had no breathe in me and also I wasnt making sense so I was so embarrassed that I looked almost as if I was having some sort of psychotic break and was “crazy” because of how I was suddenly so disoriented , which made me more anxious.

drink water. heart rate at 147. i spent the whole class sitting outside of the room. 

time to leave. great. can’t wait to get home. awesome! except i can’t drive because the panic is so bad that i can’t move my head. i call people to try and think about something else. nothing works. 25 mph on the highway in the left lane. terrifying. trying not to pee my pants out of fear. 


i make it home and sit on the floor. i call my husband telling him something is VERY wrong. he can’t leave work and im home alone for 3 hours. intrusive thoughts. racing mind. heart rate 156. have to go pick up my kids but not sure how i can
accomplish that. i walk to my in laws house (1.5 miles). okay that helped. doing better. hubby on his way. 


it took 8 hours for me to feel normal after that. still felt off the next day. i would have given anything for a xanax but i don’t take narcotics. worst panic attack of my life and i don’t even know why. 

took my 10mg lexapro and nothing else, as i do every single morning."
Your worst panic attack?,"Can somebody share stories about your worst panic attacks? I'm in bad place rn after recent panic attack, I want to be reassured by stories of others.","It happened one night after I got to know my friend's dad passed away. It was so bad. I felt like I wasn't in my body. I was getting so confused about everything. My heart was racing. I was questioning everything. It was 12 midnight and I was like is it really 12? Or is it all just a lie? I had a taxi scheduled for 6 in the morning and I was like what if the taxi person's out rn and it's actually 6 rn? It was bad. I felt like I had gone mad. And it didn't end that night and that was the issue. I popped a clonazepam pill that night and went to sleep. The next morning, nothing changed. I was an anxious freak still. I started questioning everything the next day and feeling very disconnected from everyone and everything. I started questioning reality. Am I real? Are others real? What is time? What am I doing here? What if I die today? What happens? I started therapy and psychiatric treatment and I was told that these are symptoms of existential OCD and dissociation. Boy, even advertisements scared the hell out of me. Felt like there's someone out there who's controlling everything and that we're all under control. It was bad. I'm okay now though, completely fine. It gets better. Took 6 months for me but it got better :)"

I'm in bad place rn after recent panic attack, I want to be reassured by stories of others.","I was driving on the Thruway to go take an exam. It was a certification exam that I needed to take for school. I was anxious about it all morning and the day before that, and anxiety attacks for me are less intense than panic attacks, but can often be a precursor for a panic attack. 

At the time, I had severe health anxiety. I should not have been operating a motor vehicle. I felt it come on very quickly, but there were new symptoms mixed in. I felt the life in my hands and feet suddenly leave, they became cold and numb and hard to control. I felt my heart racing pounding out of my chest. I didn't know what to do. My breathing was rapid, and I had an intense moment of feeling like I was facing imminent death. And I was terrified, amplified by the idea that if I were to die or had a heart attack while driving, I might have taken out somebody else on the road, a poor Innocent bystander. 

I don't know how I managed to recover. When I got to the facility, I had managed to calm down enough to go inside and test. Somehow I passed, but just barely. When I left, my anxiety was still there, and I narrowly avoided another panic attack on the way back. 😞"

Luckily my friend was with me but she basically called 911 and they couldn’t use elevators to haul me off on the stretcher they had to take me down a flight of stairs. The entire convention was probably staring at me.

My ex at the time knew I had bad anxiety but this was definitely one of the scariest. On our way to the ER (we opted to drive ourselves because paramedics said they didn’t have any immediate concerns of what happened but recommended to go to the hospital just to be sure. I declined all of it because it’s way too expensive and my insurance was poor, and because I felt my anxiety subsiding as we were driving. 

Went to my docs the next morning and all vitals came out fine. It’s also when I realized just how much a panic attack mimics a major illness of some sort."

I couldn't sleep for the whole1-2 night bc whenever I tried to sleep my body kept springing up and I suddenly woke up when I felt like going to sleep, I could not play games and phone and started listening to the cure music in loops. For the first time in my life, felt the fear of health anxiety (sadly, at that time I didn't know about this). I felt like I couldn't breathe. I told my mom I was afraid that my body suddenly forgot how to breathe and I had to remind myself to breathe, my body couldn't breathe automatically for 15 minutes at least. It felt like forever.

After that, I went to the hospital to check if there was nothing wrong with my brain, even paid a lot for an MRI scan as the doctor also couldn't confirm me. The result turned out that nothing was wrong and then I researched health anxiety and tried to heal it for many years. Right now my condition is better lot except for being easily stressed, having some insomnia, and being aware of all of the dangers."

Your worst panic attack?,"Can somebody share stories about your worst panic attacks? I'm in bad place rn after recent panic attack, I want to be reassured by stories of others.","I’ve been to the hospital more times than I can count, thinking that was it for me or that I was going to be put in a mental hospital. The first time it happened was on Halloween 8 years ago. I started having tunnel vision, and felt like I couldn’t catch my breath, it felt like I was going to die. My arms and fingers started going numb, and I was like omg I’m dying. I sat on a bench on a crowded street, and took off my jacket, while a friend called 911, strangers started approaching me asking if I was okay, and I was just bawling. Then a lady came by and said she was an EMT, and helped me with my breathing and holding my hands until the ambulance arrived. That was the scariest day of my life, but I still think about that lady and the rest of the kind strangers that day. 

Ever since then, I would get so scared to go outside or be in crowds, my anxiety was through the roof, and I was starting to have panic attacks several times a week. This would have me calling for an ambulance multiple times. And then when they arrived I would feel fine but ashamed/embarrassed. I sought out a therapist and psychiatrist, medication helped, and when I would feel a panic attacks several times coming I would take smallest dose of Xanax and feel so much better. 

These days, I still go through these and can often manage them, but…it feels like I’m in hell and will never be who I was years ago. I just want to feel normal, I smile but deep down I’m horribly sad. There are YouTube channels that help ease my mind with panic attack talk downs, or self meditation. I hope you can find peace and know you are not alone."
Your worst panic attack?,"Can somebody share stories about your worst panic attacks? I'm in bad place rn after recent panic attack, I want to be reassured by stories of others.","I once had a panic attack that lasted over 2 days almost non-stop. Ended up at a&e and they tried to take my blood but couldn’t because I was panicked that my muscles had all tightened in spasms. I couldn’t straighten my fingers and hands at all; it was like having a seizure. All that was because I was hyperventilating and there was too much oxygen in my body, thus leading to the terrifying cramps which made me think I was dying and which made me panic more. But I survived that and many other panic attacks. I was on lorazepam daily from age 15 - 25. 

I haven’t had a hyperventilation or panic attack in more than a decade now (I’m 37!) I realized that knowing exactly the details of why something is happening to my body while I am anxious (e.g. palpitations, cannot breathe, blurry eyes, fingers going numb and cramping up etc) helped me tremendously in realizing that I am not dying and that these symptoms are easily mitigated (e.g. slow my breathing to gain more carbon dioxide, close my eyes and hum a soothing song if im feeling dizzy, put on a video that will either relax or distract me etc). I remind myself that I am safe and that I am not going to die, it’s literally my mind trolling me. 

My turning point came when I one day just got really angry with myself and thought, you know what, if it happens it happens it’s not going to kill me and I’ll just ride it out. And when the anxiety came I simply thought, well f you, do your worst and I’ll still be around after that. And surprisingly once I didn’t give a f about what was coming, it didn’t come as bad. And after a while I learned to catch the beginnings of it and paid attention to my breathing etc. After a while even when I am panicking over something I don’t get a panic attack anymore, if you get what I mean."

Felt tired and shaky for a whole week after that."
Your worst panic attack?,"Can somebody share stories about your worst panic attacks? I'm in bad place rn after recent panic attack, I want to be reassured by stories of others.","Worst panic attack was in town on new years eve. I had sipped a wine at the park (fireworks) and then met up with a friend and her bf in a cute pub. They gave me a cider and the panic attack hit. I had to go outside and sit in the gutter because I thought I would be ill. A girl walking past made fun of me for not being able to hold my liquor. My friends bf who had come with me outside told her I was having a panic attack, she actually apologised pretty quickly. I remember that for some reason.

I eventually decided I needed to leave, problem was I was then alone in town surrounded by drunk people and an hour walk from home. I called my mum as she was home having a party with family. She was trying to calm me while trying to figure out how to get me home but my panic attacks aren't the calm kind. I suddenly hung up on her due to overload then immediately called her back because silence was worse. I asked her to put the phone up to the speaker and that was better, then she started singing along quietly as she tended to do. That did the trick.

I was able to call a taxi and get home without it getting worse and I even got to witness my mother rip my brother a new one when he said I must have been drugged, that it was similar to taking E and that I've surely done drugs before. Mum went off because a few months before it came up in conversation that dad and her thought I'd done drugs as my friends at the time were heavy on it (weed mind). I told them that I never had touched it or any drug and my friends were actually going off on anyone that offered me any cause they knew I wasn't interested. I guess mum was happy she had one kid that hadn't touched it and got protective 😅

As for the panic attack, my psychologist has recently told me something that plays in my head a bit. ""People always try to stop panic attacks, when they're next to impossible to stop once they start. What would be better to do is figuring out how to feel safe enough to get through it."" In my case that's sitting down (my blood pressure drops), telling whoever I'm with what is happening and them knowing ahead of time that I go quiet but can't be touched. They can talk but they can't talk to me and expect me to hold a conversation because it triggers my fight or flight response and I'll take off.

I also found out that those breathing exercises? We always tend to do them mid panic attack or completely forget them in the panic, when they should be practiced in your calm moments and made into a sort of routine. And just deep breaths won't cut it. You breathe slow when you're calm, so trick your brain. Deliberately slow your exhale. Breathe in for say.. 4 counts and out for 7. It also helps to ground yourself, get your thoughts out of your panicked head and onto something that requires concentration. Name countries or places or names starting with A all the way to Z. Pick out sounds you can hear. Things you can feel or see. Listen to an audiobook. Draw. Read. I tend to read signs or tags on repeat until things settle enough to function."

I was lying in my room trying to stop crying and breathing and waiting to sleep because as soon as I fell asleep, the crying stopped, but I was also afraid of sleep. So I was exhausted all around. One day, I begged my mom in tears for help, and she gave me an Ativan. I reluctantly took it, and she took me to the doctor the next day."
Your worst panic attack?,"Can somebody share stories about your worst panic attacks? I'm in bad place rn after recent panic attack, I want to be reassured by stories of others.","it was new years eve (2023 going on 2024) and i decided to sleep on the couch, i was on like 200 MG of seroquel at the time. I think it was about 1am when I felt a sensation in my chest, it was like going back and forth left side right side, and then I felt a squeezing pain in my chest. I sat up and gasped and my vision was blurry for a minute. I stood up to look at myself in the mirror but I felt super weak and looked super pale. I was begging my brother to call 9 1 1. he was annoyed at me because he thought I would calm down after an hour since I had bad panic attacks prior. the EMS came and checked my heart rate and it was up to 150 which is the highest it ever was. so instead of going in the back of the ambulance my brother took me to the ER by the house I live at. since it was new years I had to rewrite my info on the sheet of paper at the ER, it was super annoying but I couldn't even do that. my hands were so shaky. my handwriting is usually neat but this time it didn't even look like my writing. my brother had to fill out my info for me. the whole time during the waiting room my mouth felt super dry. the worst cotton mouth ever, no matter how much water i drank it wasn't working. no saliva was producing in my mouth. I felt like my brain was shutting off, it was the weirdest sensation ever. it was on and off. it got so bad to the point where I was yelling in the waiting room ""I NEED HELP"" ""SOMEOME HELP ME"" my brother was trying to shush me and I felt so bad because I normally don't act like that but at the time my body was giving me strange signals. the moment I got on the hospital bed I was talking to the doctors and nurses. they tested everything and it seems to be fine. they calmed me down with Ativan and I remember my saliva started coming back and I felt better. I was still scared tho so I texted my bf the moment I got home ""if something happens to me I love you so much"" because I was convinced I was going to die in my sleep. he knows how bad my panic attacks are. so around 2:30-3am i was completely knocked out in my bed. I woke up the next morning to my cat laying by me and many texts from my bf asking if I'm okay and that he's worried. I told him about the whole night. 

but yeah. definitely worst panic attack ever. I lowered my dosage of seroquel on my own which is dangerous but I didn't want to go through that again. I was on seroquel for a year then I mixed Prozac with it and that's when things went downhill. 

now I'm completely off medications. but yet I'm still worried for what's about to come on new years lol it felt like a curse."

It started randomly at 2am and kept me up until 4am. Every time I thought I was finally calming down, it randomly got worse. It might be more accurate to say it was two hours of multiple successive panic attacks, but I’m not really sure where one ended and another started; either way, it was pretty miserable.

Halfway through my shift, my heart was racing and I started feeling dizzy. I told the other chef to take care of things for me for a minute so I can go to the restroom. I spent maybe 5 minutes in the bathroom trying to calm myself down and splashing water on my face. I went back into the kitchen to resume work and I started getting tunnel vision and felt like I was going to pass out. I took a step out back and sat in the parking lot where I was shivering and having cold sweats. Everyone came outside to check if I was ok. I felt extremely weak and couldn’t get back to work. I had to have my brother come pick me up, literally, from work. I got into bed when I got home but the adrenaline and extreme tiredness feeling didn’t wear off for a couple days and I kept having mini anxiety attacks for maybe a week.

I’ve gotten better about navigating through panic attacks now so they haven’t been as bad or frequent. Working out for 30 minutes daily and doing breathing exercises have helped a lot. I feel like fixing my sleep schedule might help too because my anxiety feels much worse on days I’ve barely slept."

My mind started racing thinking of all the mistakes I ever made or xyz conversations that made me look (insert self deprecating comment). Got really  dizzy and ran to my mom’s room. 

I told her what was going on and suddenly realized I might be in the beginning stages of a heart attack. Two ppl in HS passed away from it so that intensified the paranoia. 

She drove me to the ER and got an EKG scan and some other tests done. Turned out to be a massive panic attack. The doctor said I needed to control my stress and take care of myself 🙃"

Couldn't slow my breathing down. Full of terror that I would die at any moment. Hours in the ER with clear blood tests and high BP. Home and slept with lights on and listened to music.

In the following months, I didn't drink, ate better, learned mindfulness, learned calming techniques, tried an SSRI, went to AA meetings, walked every morning, exercised every day, battled repeat, mini panic, and re-connected with my faith.

This attack was, and I believe generally is, an accumulation of recent family medical trauma, my own past military and public safety work trauma, poor stress management, bad diet, too much alcohol, and weak ""pillars"" of my life.

Since then I've shored up my pillars as ownership, mindfulness, movement, boundaries, connection, sleep, and faith. They make all the difference in the world.

Godspeed."

It's now been a full week and while I still have this baseline ice water sensation from my brain stem down into my shoulders, it has been improving.

Doctor who I went to see told me it was a heart attack, and it scared me a lot. 
I did a lot of tests afterwards, from CT scan, echo, stress tests, ecgs blood tests, brain MRIs, etc, and so far I found to be healthy, with just some mild signs of early hypertension due to anxiety. Seen cardiologists, neurologists, ENY doctors, ophtalmologists, etc. 
All said I am fine and it is just anxiety.

It was so bad one night I couldn't sleep. I lay in bed the entire night so tired and sleepy but too panicky and with too many worries for my body to relax for more than ten minutes.

After the panic attack subsides I'm left with a sore chest for days, I'll also get little pin pricks of pain randomly. I believe this is due to ""costochondritis,"" because of all the muscle stress I put on my chest area changing position, breath and adrenaline. After a week or so it goes away."

New retail job black Friday anxiety. Any advice?,"Brand new in retail and nervous. Any advice? 

Hi everyone! 

  I just started a part time seasonal job in retail and its my very first experience in retail. I have only done two 4 hour shifts and I’m scheduled for Black Friday. I still feel so lost and am very nervous about working on such a busy day when I’m still brand new and learning. I’m ok with basic transactions but when customers need other things I still have no idea what I’m doing. It's a very busy big store at the mall so I’m dreading how tomorrow will go. I am doing ok but have made a few mistakes which is embarrassing. I got flustered and just wanted to run off and cry. 

Any advice or kind words are appreciated. Thank you so so much!!!! ","First of all, you’ve gotta remember that you’re still so new and learning so many things, be kind to yourself even if you make mistakes! Plus, that’s how you’ll learn :) (I know it sucks lol)

I worked retail for nearly 6 years and have been through so many black Friday, Boxing Day, closing sales and I promise you, it’s not as bad once you’re in it. You may experience a constant flow of people and you may get tired, but hopefully your coworkers are nice! We used to joke around that we were heading into battle and we’d find way to have fun during the chaos of it all.

I think at this point before your shift or even during, just talk to someone about how you’re feeling a little nervous and it would be great if you could lean on them whenever you have a question or something comes up that you don’t quite know how to handle. Remember, you’re very new and your managers/supervisors should be there to support and help you.

All in all, you’ll do great and you’ll end up having some fun! Here if you ever wanna chat!"

Any advice or kind words are appreciated. Thank you so so much!!!! ","how did it go? The coming days will still be busy but my advice is SLOW DOWN a bit and take your time. its easy to let the chaotic energy and people trying to rush you take over, and thats when mistakes happen. dont be afraid to take a breath and just pause for a sec to think about what you need to do. Better to take a few extra seconds and do it right! 

Dont be afraid to step away and go to the bathroom or something if you need a moment of peace. obviously dont spend like 10 minutes in the bathroom for no reason, but its okay to lie and say you need to go to the bathroom and just take a few minutes to breathe and recenter yourself in a quiet space.

   
Also just remember its neverrrr that serious. Even being new, im sure your best judgement and common sense will stop you from making any BAD mistakes - everything else can be fixed, or is a learning opportunity. and at the end of the day, anything that can be bought at a mall is not that important and people can wait - they are choosing to shop at the busiest time of year, they will need to learn to be patient!"

Im not saying you dont need the fundamentals, but as you spend time in the system it is who you know vs. what you can do. There are terrible employees who socialize well and get all the benefits while the best staff with low EQ are shafted."

Every time I took a sick day, I'd lie in bed getting more and more certain that I'd be fired the next day. Sometimes it got so bad I'd take a second day to make it seem more believable, then spend that entire day getting even more worked up about the definitely catastrophic results when I returned to the office.

Every single time, I'd arrive at work and nobody would even say a thing. Not the slightest hint of a problem. I'd almost be crying from relief.

Even after I'd been observing this pattern for decades it didn't get any easier."
A dog bit me,"My psychiatrists told me I had GAD, and they said my mother is the root cause for all of that. Recently, I got admitted to ER after my left arm got mauled by a pitbull. My mum was concerned and have shown more efforts to contact me almost every day, even asking about my wellbeing, if I've eaten or not, if my arm was hurting. Mind you, we fought a lot, and when we fought, she didn't even attempt to reach out to me, and immediately cut her financial support.

I had this desire to continue my education before all this tragedy happened, I let my mother know that. She said she will support me. Then she sent me money. Then we fought again, and she stopped sending me money. I was frustrated. Why does she keep doing this? I need to pay my school. So like any sensible adult, I looked for a job. I find a part-time job at a warehouse, where the pay is fine. The catch is, it's a labour job of course, and the shift ends at midnight. That was when I was surrounded by around 7 dogs when I walked back from work, and how I ended up in the ER.

My therapist told me I should find a support system other than her. Well, she's never my support system in the first place. My grandparents, the people who raised me, especially my grandmother, had always had my back. Now they're gone, and I was left with my *ughh* mum who insists she will always be there for me, when she's not. Recently, I think I said something that hurt her feelings. I told her I want a picture of my cat. Her side of family took care of my cat after I moved out to the city. I don't know why she sounded upset, when I asked abouty cat. She said I should visit them, her family. 

First of all, I'm not close to any of her family. They are like this loud close knit clan (with many dramas and chaos), and I had bad memories dealing with her family. Plus, most of them stayed in this one small house, with my ex-convict uncle was there, and so was my ill aunt who had schizophrenia. Second, her family didn't even visit me when I was in the hospital, except one of my uncle, who lived separately from them. My mother made excuses they were busy. I insisted I want a picture of my cat, but my mum told me her family was busy. And after that, she didn't even reach out to me again. I honestly don't understand what happened. I just want a picture of my cat, or is it the fact she knows I don't want to see her family? I don't know, I'm tired of my mum playing these games.

I used to work as a sales, then after I signed to volunteer at my country's service army (it's not regular army), I was forced to resign because the company I worked at couldn't give me 1 month leave for my training, even unpaid, for just 1 month. It's not regular army training, it's up to me if I want to attend their occasional training, but to be part of this voluntary service army, I need to attend one month of basic compulsory training. Still, my company won't give me 1 month leave. I understand that. That's how I ended up jobless after the training. 

As for my mum, I barely see her. Maybe once every 3-5 years. She worked overseas. She was quite wealthy, but barely gave any child support when I was a kid. Now, I'm adult, she said it's not her responsibility. I get that. I'm an adult. Maybe she needs to feed her 5 grown ass siblings and their kids, who knows. Because I kept seeing my uncles got some money from her. And I've heard she send some money to my cousin who's studying. But every now and then, even after I was jobless, she always promises she will be there for me, she will support me. But the moment we clash again, she sends me a lengthy message reminding me my life sucks, stops her resources, and maybe bitch to her family she had this terrible daughter.

I'm tired from all of these. I am recovering, I just need someone to be there for me. I had no friends I could rely on. I feel like I want to cry, but I can't. I should have listen to my therapist that I shouldn't rely on my mother, find some support group. Honestly, that's why I'm excited to go back to school, but I'm also afraid my GAD or because of my damn mother makes me hard to connect to any of my coursemates. I'm really terrified of my future.



Edit:  The institution I enrolled in had government subsidised most of the fees, and I'll be receiving allowances for my studies. If my mother knows about this, she's more than happy to not send me any money. The institution I enrolled in stated in the agreement that students are not allowed to work, and parents still need to give some allowances to students. ","This sounds really rough and frustrating. I’m sorry you’re having to experience all this. 

It’s good that you have a psychiatrist and therapist you can talk to about all this. 

Do you have a faith community of any kind that can be with you as well? Days when my anxiety is worst or I feel most alone, spending time with my church has been helpful for encouragement. 

One big thing I’ve personally been trying to work on a lot is the line between content and complacent. I don’t want to be complacent. I want to learn, grow, help people, challenge myself. But I do want to be content. Grateful and thankful for the little things I get to experience every day. 

Of course, much easier said than done when wrestling with anxiety though."
A dog bit me,"My psychiatrists told me I had GAD, and they said my mother is the root cause for all of that. Recently, I got admitted to ER after my left arm got mauled by a pitbull. My mum was concerned and have shown more efforts to contact me almost every day, even asking about my wellbeing, if I've eaten or not, if my arm was hurting. Mind you, we fought a lot, and when we fought, she didn't even attempt to reach out to me, and immediately cut her financial support.

I had this desire to continue my education before all this tragedy happened, I let my mother know that. She said she will support me. Then she sent me money. Then we fought again, and she stopped sending me money. I was frustrated. Why does she keep doing this? I need to pay my school. So like any sensible adult, I looked for a job. I find a part-time job at a warehouse, where the pay is fine. The catch is, it's a labour job of course, and the shift ends at midnight. That was when I was surrounded by around 7 dogs when I walked back from work, and how I ended up in the ER.

My therapist told me I should find a support system other than her. Well, she's never my support system in the first place. My grandparents, the people who raised me, especially my grandmother, had always had my back. Now they're gone, and I was left with my *ughh* mum who insists she will always be there for me, when she's not. Recently, I think I said something that hurt her feelings. I told her I want a picture of my cat. Her side of family took care of my cat after I moved out to the city. I don't know why she sounded upset, when I asked abouty cat. She said I should visit them, her family. 

First of all, I'm not close to any of her family. They are like this loud close knit clan (with many dramas and chaos), and I had bad memories dealing with her family. Plus, most of them stayed in this one small house, with my ex-convict uncle was there, and so was my ill aunt who had schizophrenia. Second, her family didn't even visit me when I was in the hospital, except one of my uncle, who lived separately from them. My mother made excuses they were busy. I insisted I want a picture of my cat, but my mum told me her family was busy. And after that, she didn't even reach out to me again. I honestly don't understand what happened. I just want a picture of my cat, or is it the fact she knows I don't want to see her family? I don't know, I'm tired of my mum playing these games.

I used to work as a sales, then after I signed to volunteer at my country's service army (it's not regular army), I was forced to resign because the company I worked at couldn't give me 1 month leave for my training, even unpaid, for just 1 month. It's not regular army training, it's up to me if I want to attend their occasional training, but to be part of this voluntary service army, I need to attend one month of basic compulsory training. Still, my company won't give me 1 month leave. I understand that. That's how I ended up jobless after the training. 

As for my mum, I barely see her. Maybe once every 3-5 years. She worked overseas. She was quite wealthy, but barely gave any child support when I was a kid. Now, I'm adult, she said it's not her responsibility. I get that. I'm an adult. Maybe she needs to feed her 5 grown ass siblings and their kids, who knows. Because I kept seeing my uncles got some money from her. And I've heard she send some money to my cousin who's studying. But every now and then, even after I was jobless, she always promises she will be there for me, she will support me.

","I'm not quite active in any faith community. I did participate in one, but I had bad experiences with it, it feels like a cult, hence I quit. My anxiety and depression did lessen when I joined the service army training. You're surrounded with  people with background differences, bad and good, building camaraderie by going through the same hardships. One person made a mistake, one team bears the consequences of it. So like it or not, one teammate needs to help each other. I feel like I'm not much of a good comrade, a toxic one indeed, but I had instructors and teammates understanding of me. I felt heard and seen.


There's no more training this year, so I don't have anything to do. All I need is to wait for school enrollment next year. I need to compile all the required documents and I dread having to ask my mum to be my guarantor."
Coping methods to help calm anxiety before and at the start of presentation ,"I’m in my early 40s and I’ve had a life long anxiety associated with presenting in front of groups at work. It’s something that held me back professionally for a long period of my early life, until about 5 years ago when I just decided that I couldn’t afford to let it throttle me anymore.

I’m now in a senior role in Tech and have to face my fear fairly regularly. The typical scenario would be a meeting of about 20-30 people, where I have to present a section. 

About a week before these meetings the real stress starts, and I start losing sleep. Thanks to lots of prep and practically memorising every word, during the presentations, I always do ok. As soon as I’m into my flow my anxiety mostly disappears and dare I say it, I sometimes start enjoying it. 

But the anxiety when I’m sat around the table waiting for my turn to present is so intense, physically uncomfortable and scary (I still get the “shall I just run away?” thoughts).  I do all the usual breathing exercises, try and clear my mind, etc, but haven’t really found anything that consistently works. 

The specific part that I’d like to get under control is the first 30 seconds. When it’s my turn to present I often get a huge dump of adrenaline and my heart rate and breathing just shoots up (despite having basically been meditating at the table beforehand!).  I then spend the first minute of the presentation trying to get my breathing under control whilst trying to talk and it’s just really difficult. 

I get myself under control eventually and then I deliver a good presentation. I just wish I didn’t have to go through this every time. It’s upsetting, stressful and just doesn’t feel good for my health! I was hoping that if I just carried on doing these things it would improve but it’s not got any better and is the main source of anxiety in my life. Because i can’t avoid this in my job, it basically means i now have a constant low level of anxiety. 

Does anybody have any advice for things I can do to try and make that first 30 seconds easier, and try and avoid the adrenaline/mega heart rate/accelerated breathing thing? 

Ideally I’d like to try and get a grip on this without having to speak to my Doctor and get medication. But I’m at a point where I probably need to try anything and everything. 

Thanks so much to anybody that read this far! ","It is a common thing.

Have you investigated Toastmasters?  This is specifically what it is for.  A number of people in my group are in tech fields and have used this to help them to get through this.

you can go as quickly or as slowly as you need.  In toastmasters you also practice other roles like time keeping,  monitoring filler words and reviewing others speeches.

(no I have not drunk any koolaid or anything).

you can go to [toastmasters.org](http://toastmasters.org) and look for local chapters and visit usually either in person or via zoom."

The actual presenting part - I’m fine with. The ironic thing about all of this is I’m actually a genuinely decent presenter and often get complimented on it (probably because I spend days preparing and perfecting!).

The other weird thing about this is that I could probably attend something like Toastmasters and feel absolutely fine and chill when talking to that group. 

This is such a weird and very specific situational  based thing that happens exclusively at work when I have to present a section. During the very same meetings I will happily speak during freestyle periods, ask questions, answer questions etc. 

I just fear that Toastmasters or something similar won’t replicate the sterile ultra professional setting I find myself in.  (But maybe I’m making excuses for myself)."

and we each have our own ""spot of trouble"" this is what it is about. I myself used to speak in front of many people no problem. after losing my spouse it changed. 

it is about practice. the only thing that changes is practice. One of our members had to deliver a presentation created by a professor and she hated how it was so she practiced with us.

I've seen practice of giving speeches for advancement talks, etc.

there is another thing which could similate what you are talking about.  It is called table topics and the speakers must talk for 90 or 120 seconds on an ad hoc question or topic.  Very good for cold intros.

just go there and look and see what you think.  you can guess as many times and as many clubs as you might want. 

In my group we have everyone from immigrants looking to improve their second language to CEOs, doctors who regularly give tv interviews, and many others."
Hand feels very light ,"Hi everyone,

Hoping you can help me.

I am having this recurring symptom where my right hand specifically (I am right handed) feels very light / unnatural. This is to say that when I move it / perform a task, instead of feeling its usual weight, it feels super light and almost disconnected. There is no functional issue so I assume it's all perception.

This in turn is causing me quite a bit of anxiety especially when I focus/fixate on it and on a couple of occasions more severe panic attacks - although I have felt a little more unstable than usual in the past 6 months so there may be something wider than this - or this may be root cause making me anxious.

Has anyone experienced this before?

I am unmedicated currently but considering options. The feeling does seem to come and go    In strength terms but seems to keep a baseline level. 

I have had this too about 5 years ago but went away after 2 months or so, now it's been 6 months this time and hence starting to worry 😓

Thanks in advance ",I have the floaty arms feeling also! But they also feel weak and heavy at times along with both my legs. i am going 3 months like this so far and it is everyday but days its not so strong.

How to get rid of chest pain as a teenager?,"Please help. I get  chest pain/tightness from anxiety and its been effecting all aspects of my life lately. Im not old enough to go to the doctor myself and get meds or something because my parents dont really believe anxiety is a thing. I try to do breathing exercises but they dont work, i feel like ive tried all the grounding techniques but this pain barely ever goes away. ","I’m in a similar position to you currently!! 

This may sound dumb and like it won’t work, but best way to get over any thoughts causing physical symptom is to just simply let the thoughts happen. Hear me out, if you just sit with the thoughts rather than fighting them and just let yourself be okay with the chest pain, that’s how it will go away. The more you fixate on the feeling and thoughts and try to do everything to stop them, the more they happen!

If someone tells you to NOT think about something, the first thing everyone does is think about it. It’s intrusive, you can’t stop it. But the thoughts only stops when you just let yourself think about it, eventually your mind just gives up. 

With every symptom I’ve ever had, my mind always eventually lets it go. But sadly I’m currently stuck in a loop of having a symptom -> worry about it -> it feels so severe -> my mind finds something else to latch onto and worry about -> previous symptom goes away completely. I hope this helps, I’m a teenager just like you and have had to learn a lot over time. :)"

Tiny insect?,Last night i felt a tiny insect land on my nose i think it may’ve been a fruit fly and i’ve been freaking out it’s gone up my nose. Can it get to my brain? I’ve been feeling all sorts of weird itchy or moving sensations all over my body but i’m hoping it’s the anxiety making me feel these things,"No, even if an insect did crawl up your nose (fruitflies dont do that), they can not get to your brain. There is a very durable shield that separates the nasal cavity from the brain. Otherwise, our brains would get infected by the bacteria and other pathogens that we breathe everyday - we would all die very shortly if the brain was exposed."

I remember seeing this one TikTok that was like “this is how humans were supposed to see themselves” and she was outside filming a puddle, a pond, etc. because back then humans didn’t have mirrors. 

It made me think about how maybe our brains are sensitive to our reflections because it doesn’t know how to process it very well. 

Glad mirrors were invented though"

I need serious help. Please read,"Title says it all. This isnt “crowds make me anxious” stuff. I need help but don’t know where to receive help. To start it all off, i never struggled with anxiety my whole life. NEVER. I was very out going, happy. About 8 months ago i had a near death experience. And it ruined me. I wont go into detail about that, because it doesn’t matter. What does on the other hand, is how all of the sudden my mental health has plummeted.

First, it started as panic attacks. A hospital visit  once a week. Seriously. I have a $100 co-pay for emergency visits with my insurance, and now i owe upwards of $2,500. But yeah, like i said, panic attacks. They subdued recently. But now im collapsing due to CONSTANT anxiety. So bad ive had suicidal thoughts. I get about 2 hours of sleep a night. No joke. Ill go a week sleeping like that till my body and mind cant keep up and i crash, and sleep for 16 hours straight. The bags under my eyes are dark, its a chore to laugh or smile, i am genuinely being effected by this. 

Not to mention, i have a son on the way. Me and my GF of 3 years are expecting in less than 2 months now. Our relationship is very good. But my mental health is affecting everything around me. Bills, work, relationships, sleep, happiness, you name it. I want to be better for my family. 

Ill end this by saying what i have tried. Meds, doctors visits, sleep aids, meditation, positive self talk, vitamins, supplements, massages. 

WTF DO I DO. I visibly just LOOK sick. End rant.","It sounds like you experienced a traumatic event leading to panic attacks, compounded by all the other stuff you have going on.

Forget the ER, this likely has zero to do with any physical issue like your heart. It's anxiety, they'll give you anxiety meds or an IV and charge you a buttload of money.

What you need to do is meet with a psychiatrist and get on anxiety meds. You can get benzodiazapines for a rescue medication for the panic attacks (they kick in very quickly and are out of your system in 3 or so hours) in addition to something daily. This will both lower your anxiety and increase your tolerance for dealing with anxiety. If your anxiety is a 9/10 right now, meds alone can drop you to 6/10 easy.

Panic attacks are simply high anxiety plus adrenaline. Adrenaline is a huge boost of energy and when it gets directed 100% at anxiety, you spiral. Panic attacks alone cause a feedback loop. They suck so much you fear having another one, that fear builds anxiety until it reaches the maximum and you have a panic attack. Panic attacks causing panic attacks aka panic disorder. You essentially need to break the chain in some manner. 

Maybe you've done all this, whatever, keep doing it. Meds are trial and error. Sometimes you take a pill for 2 weeks and you find out you feel the same or worse. You waltz back into the appointment and ask for an adjustment. You try that out. Rinse and repeat. It's just the easiest and most effective way to lower anxiety. Therapy is the other route."

I noticed you asked in another comment what PTSD is, but it's different for everyone. Before I knew I had it I stopped leaving the house and would have delusions. A few times I woke up to panic attacks. I wouldn't have flashbacks but every day was so disheartening. It just tore pieces of me apart.

I never thought I would be able to hold down a job again, but with therapy I went from barely being able to leave the house to returning to full time work.

I recent started seeing a somatic experiencing therapist. I found my practitioner via this website:https://directory.traumahealing.org/ I frantically messaged about 15 of them and one practitioner called me back and took me in on a sliding scale rate. It’s been incredibly helpful for me. You should simultaneously  look for therapists who work with trauma via your health insurance. 
You can also talk to a psychiatrist about outpatient intensive treatment and that may require u to go on state disability. 
I’ve suffered from anxiety for years and years and I truly think that calming your parasympathetic nervous system is the answer. Other things you should really try to do are yoga, exercise, quit caffeine for a while, and try to educate yourself about trauma and how the body holds on to that. Cause knowledge is power. Also stop going to urgent care every week they can’t help u. You are the one who will get yourself out of this by doing deep healing work"

But yeah, like i said, panic attacks. They subdued recently. But now im collapsing due to CONSTANT anxiety. So bad ive had suicidal thoughts. I get about 2 hours of sleep a night. No joke. Ill go a week sleeping like that till my body and mind cant keep up and i crash, and sleep for 16 hours straight. The bags under my eyes are dark, its a chore to laugh or smile, i am genuinely being effected by this. 

Not to mention, i have a son on the way. Me and my GF of 3 years are expecting in less than 2 months now. Our relationship is very good. But my mental health is affecting everything around me. Bills, work, relationships, sleep, happiness, you name it. I want to be better for my family.

Yikes. Congratulations for staying alive & showing some resiliency. Now, I do think you're traumatized. Near-death, extreme stressful and heart wrenching situations can  deplete a number of nutrients especially the sedative-like ones such as zinc, calcium & magnesium. Not a go ahead to buy supplements. But it is to open up an avenue of an aspect of trauma which gets overlooked which is the physical & nutritional aspects of it."

After it happened the anxiety didn’t kick in right away but the experience left a gnawing thought it my head that grew and grew over time until it came out as my first ever panic attack. At some point later on I began to spiral downward mentally. What has been helping me was to educate myself about anxiety. I read books, listen to podcasts, therapy, w/e I think is relevant. Demystifying it helps make it seem less scary. I’m slowly climbing out of the hole my mind dug for me, why I feel like there is hope for you as well."

It took a long time and a lot of reading, experimenting and trial and error to finally put it all together and break free. I'm pretty sure I can point you in the right direction. It's a program that teaches you how your mind really works and how to get ahold of it so old unhelpful programs don't ruin your life. The ""program"" you are ""running on"" since your NDE is deeply entrenched into your limbic system because of how terrifying the experience was. Your mind will not let it go because it thinks it is protecting you. The program was like $300 when I took it. Not sure how much now, but so worth it. I will be buying my kids the course when they are a little older so they can deprogram from all the stress bs I oozed onto them. Message me and I'll send you the link. I'm not sure how recommneds like that work on here.  ✌🏼💜"

I built a tolerance to those very quickly because i was taking them almost every night. He game me 0.5 mg of ativan. Take as needed. But that felt like putting a bandaid on a deep cut.

WTF DO I DO. I visibly just LOOK sick. End rant.","Another piece of advice, don't use benzos to sleep. If you have sleep issues, take melatonin or ask for a prescription for ambien. I know anxiety before bed is BRUTAL, it's literally one of the only times of the day you are alone with your thoughts, but it's a waste of the medication and a waste of your tolerance. .5 MG is a low dose - but most prescribers are pretty cautious about prescribing any benzos. Ativan is nice because it's probably the fastest to kick in, but it's also the fastest to get out of your system. Examine your average day, figure out when anxiety is the worst, and plan the Ativan around that. 

I'm shocked your prescriber didn't start you out on an SSRI, that's usually the first thing they try. Simply because it works for most people. SSRIs can have some annoying side effects and take 2 weeks to build levels in your body. So you might feel like crap for 2 weeks, then all of a sudden you have levels and feel great. Or maybe the side-effects remain - in which you report this to your prescriber and try something new. What you report is essential. Daily medication will remove reliance you have on the Ativan, allowing you to use it as more of a rescue medication. The longer of a stretch throughout the day you can go without feeling very anxious, the easier it is to break the feedback loop. Therapy is great for developing strategies. Personally, I had to plan around work. I'd go to the bathroom and splash cold water on my face to kind of shock my system out of it and ground me to reality. VERY sour candies are also really good at this. It pulls you out of your thoughts and puts you back in your body. Any intense physical sensation can do this, like cold water to the face. Deep breaths, a podcast that distracts you, literally whatever knocks you down from 8/10 anxiety to 7/10."

WTF DO I DO. I visibly just LOOK sick. End rant.","Go to a psychiatrist if you haven't already. They specialize in mental health meds. The General Practioners don't really know as much about psych meds. I know the feeling you are going through. What helped me was Therapy, Medications from a Psychiatrist MD or Psychiatric PA, trying a a few different Anti-depressants, a benzo with a long half life like Clonazepam, and of course, natural methods like you have been doing. EFT tapping is helpful when I'm having spiraling anxiety. They used to help with panic attacks too. You feel like you are actively doing something to combat the panic and anxiety instead of passively trying to calm, like meditation. All tools are good. It takes a mix. 

I have not full-on panicked since I started on Clonazepam, and I've been on it for 6 years. Never needed to increase my .5mg three times per day. I'm actually prescribed for 2mg per day, but I consider 1.5mg total a win each day. Clonazepam has a very long half-life and stays in your system longer. The rise and fall of the efficacy of the drug lessened. It's stays more even. Gabapentin helps with nerves as well, and my Prozac(Fluoxetine) has been the one that helps, after trying 4 other AD's. 

There are side effects, but it's better than a panic attack or severe anxiety. Panic attacks, especially, are traumatic themselves. I think some kind of doorway opens in your brain when you have such a traumatic event or events happen. I have never been able to fully close that door. Whereas neurotypical people can relax and close that door when the temporary stress or anxiety eases, like after a job interview or speaking in public, we have trouble keeping the panic and anxiety monsters behind that door. We need helpers jusr to push it almost closed."

First, it started as panic attacks. A hospital visit  once a week. Seriously. I have a $100 co-pay for emergency visits with my insurance, and now i owe upwards of $2,500. But yeah, like i said, panic attacks. They subdued recently. But now im collapsing due to CONSTANT anxiety. So bad ive had suicidal thoughts. I get about 2 hours of sleep a night. No joke.

I had something very similar. It changed me, and I kept waiting for it to go away. It would briefly, but I developed a lot of anxiety triggers, depressive episodes, and derealization/depersonalization.Basically, I just got to the point where I knew I needed help. I started with therapy(DBT/CBT). During therapy, it became obvious that I was dealing with trauma from a specific health event. We are now starting EMDR therapy for the trauma. I am a lot better and expect to be ""back"" during this stage of therapy."

Yes- you need to talk to get referred to a psychiatrist via your insurance. Ask them about possibilities of outpatient intensive treatment. See what your options are.

WTF DO I DO. I visibly just LOOK sick. End rant.","The stellate ganglion blocker is a shot you get in the Stellate Ganglion. It is a VERY effective treatment for PTSD/Anxiety and only takes 15-60 minutes to kick in. It essentially stops your body from being able to experience anxiety. When my brother in law got it I was so skeptical but within 30 minutes after he got the shot he started crying and said “I forgot this is what it feels like to be happy”. So that sent me down a rabbit hole to educate myself on it better and ultimately decided it was best for me. As I never had ANY luck with meds, therapy, exercise, breathing techniques. My ptsd was simply too much to just be treated in the ways others find helpful and I tied EVERYTHING more than once.
The only downside is that some people do need a second shot after a year.  But everyone’s so wildly different that you just never know what you’ll need. Some people have only ever needed one shot for 5-6 years and they are fine.

This is a YT video to help explain a bit more.

It’ll be helpful to read other threads and ask questions to those who’ve had it. Just don’t rely solely on that because everyone has such a different experience with it but it’s definitely worth still reading the variety of reviews."
In need of good ways to cope,"Hello all, 
Apologies if my situation sounds dumb but I just recently hit 30 and I’m scared. I’m scared of the thought of losing my parents soon (59 & 56), and i’m scared more of the thought that someday I will die. Whatever your beliefs, mine is the mindset of I just don’t know and unsure about afterlife and right now the thoughts of there being no afterlife terrify my every waking thoughts. I’m set into panic attacks constantly and I know that I’m draining and taxing on my friends, family and anyone else I might’ve reached out to at this period. I’m scared and my comforts(gaming, movies, books, music) aren’t helping. Lately I’ve been reaching out to anyone I used to know just to feel the comfort of not feeling alone but I’m still constant besieged by this rampant anxiety. I need help. I need opinions. I need suggestions. Anything will help and I appreciate it. 

Yes, I’ve sought therapy. In fact, as this began I entered therapy realizing that this may become a huge problem in this chapter in life. Had my first therapy session on Monday but she won’t be available until January with the soonest bridging appointment not available until middle of December. 

I want to enjoy my holiday season with my family. Thank you in advanced all of you. ","Fear arises because you have not yet lived fully. When you live with totality, fear disappears. You are afraid of death because you have not tasted life yet. Once you start living intensely, passionately, in the moment, you will come to know that death is not the end but a transformation, a passage.

The idea of losing your parents or your own life is tied to clinging—to the known, to the familiar. But life is a flow; everything is impermanent, constantly changing. The moment you embrace this impermanence, you are free. Instead of fearing the end, celebrate the now, for this moment is all there is.

The afterlife is not the problem; the problem is whether you are alive here and now. Death is simply a part of life’s rhythm. Meditate, go inwards, and discover that which is eternal within you—that is the only way to move beyond fear."
Dizziness for years ,"I had a big ol’ panic attack in March 2021, have felt dizzy, almost drunk ever since. 
I know many of us are going through the same thing, whether we label it as DPDR, dissociation, GAD, though I’ve never understood why we get it as a symptom. 
It’s more annoying now as I don’t consider myself anxious anymore, but this symptom of feeling like I’m playing a dizzying video game just won’t budge. 

I have my moments of clarity, but man, am I bored of this feeling. 

Any tips or tricks welcomed - any explanations equally as such!

Thanks all x","Hi mate. Have you eliminated physical stuff by checking heart, head, neck, etc?"

is this anxiety?,"i’m not here looking for a diagnosis or anything i just want to understand myself better. Sometimes when something “bad” happens, i have this sinking feeling in my stomach, my heart rate becomes higher than usual and i lose my appetite. I also am unable to study and i feel like i can’t do anything but stay in bed because i feel sort of unstable (as in mentally)? It happened for the first time 2 years ago and that time it was the worst, it lasted about 2 weeks and i kept waking up at night because of how quick my heart rate was and it felt like i was running even tho i was lying down (that’s the best i can explain) and i threw up my food because of nerves. Ever since then it’s happened about id say 3/4 times? idk what this is i hate this feeling and its happening rn i can literally hear my own heart beat and i want to cry.
I’m sorry if this sounds completely unrelated to this thread i didn’t know where else to post.
",It could be. But hard to say based only on this description.

","Yea what Antionio said, it’s hard to tell by your description. I can only speak from my experience but one vague way i like to think about it is that anxiety is when you’re nervous about something that hasn’t happened yet and depression is about the past. Anxiety can work in clear way like when you are overly nervous for a presentation and you get the feeling leading up to it. It can also be something from your subconscious. For example, that bad thing that happened might still be affecting your thought and it is making you feel the way you do because your body doesn’t know if the threat is still there. I’ve gotten anxiety for random things but i mostly feel it when i have something in mind, like gathering with family for thanksgiving today. However, you could also have quite a few things that are altogether making you feel this way. The symptoms you are saying happen with anxiety and could be honestly happening for the same reason you are writing this post. You are anxious about your health right now and are constantly checking your heart rate which is stressing you out even more. I’ve been in your position before with writing reddit posts for things like this and the best thing would honestly be to go to a doctor just to settle your nerves. 99% of the time they’ll tell you your feeling anxiety, and probably over 50% of patients get check ups for things that are mentally affecting them more than physical. At the same time you can tell that a fast heart rate isn’t normal when you’re sleeping so maybe something is going on. I’m not saying that to try and scare you but you honestly won’t know what wrong with you unless you go to the doctor. If there isn’t anything they see, then it’ll most likely go away because you will feel safe knowing a doctor couldn’t find anything wrong with you. 

Also if it is anxiety it won’t be something that’ll go away forever. When first experiencing anxiety a lot of people try to fight it and find a cure but the only way to help yourself is to accept you have it and that you will still be able to get through everything the same way you already have. Sorry for the long reply but i’ve been in your position before and want you to know what has worked for me."

How do I go back to normal and stop overthinking the simple action of swallowing?","Yeah no problem. I always try to help people with this since I went through this myself, so I can relate."

Vision being weird,"Hi, has anybody experienced changes in vision bc of anxiety/very stressful periods?? I've (18F) had a few stressful and anxiety-inducing events recently, and a week ago, I noticed that my eyes are tired and sometimes even stinging (mostly bc of not sleeping bc of anxiety) and I also sometimes see a bit double/blurry, but it's only for a little while before it goes back to normal - this happens all day, on and off. Lights at night also seem a bit fuzzy (kinda like astigmatism but not as bad, just like, spikey if that makes sense) and I can now also see rainbow hues around lights at night. No other symptoms though. I've also used eye drops for dry eyes, but it hasn't changed anything.

I've never had vision problems before. I've thought about the fact that I maybe need glasses, mostly bc I do a lot of school work on my computer/phone and I use social media, but I try my best to keep my screentime on my phone under 2 hours. But since I'm still pretty young, I don't really know what to think, especially because it was not really a gradual thing - I noticed it all of a sudden.

So it this like, a normal/expected thing when dealing with anxiety?
Thanks im advance :)

How to stop overthinking? ,"How do I stop overthinking and stop thinking something bad is going to happen. My mind is thinking about way too many thoughts at once I hate this feeling. I’m always worried about something bad happening to my loved ones. My mind wants to plan each and everything with steps, timeline, and just wants to do everything at once. I’m always irritated and snap easily. I want to be left alone and not talked to. I feel so guilty all the time because of how easily irritated I get, and I know the people around me don’t deserve that. I have many things to be grateful for, but my mind is just idk. 

I’m not on any meds, and I don’t really want to be. All meds have side effects that I do not want to deal with. I was thinking about propranolol because it helps with the physical symptoms of anxiety like palpitations which I have the entire day, but it’s associated with brain fog and I can’t have that right now as I’m preparing for exams.","You must know, that your exciety is lying to you, creating fake scenarios and presuming worst case scenarios.
Mindfulness practices will really help you, loock for them online.

How do I stop waking up feeling anxious with nausea?,"I wake up every morning feeling nausea and sick, feeling heavy chest, general anxiety and dry mouth. This triggers my emetophobia which then triggers my anxiety worse. Recently my anxiety is a lot worse and I keep getting waves of this feeling through the day. ","I used to experience this every day when i was in school and even through college. I still experience it now but not as severe and it goes away extremely quickly. 

I find that if you are properly prepared for whatever you’re doing the next day you’ll wake up less anxious but it’s also just about getting into a routine. Wake up, immediately get up and wash and don’t give yourself time to be anxious"

My anxiety is slowly turning into paranoia and Im scared,"It started with staying home a lot more, I was always anxious to leave the house alone. The anxiety of going to work or going out on errands   turned into varying degrees of worse and worse things that could happen to me if I leave the house ALONE.

Its literally nonsense, I know its not real, none of it is real but the feeling I have when I try to ignore it makes me physically ill.

I cannot fathom the idea of leaving my house alone unless I’m going to meet someone, I’m terrified because this honestly could get really bad. I feel too anxious to contact anyone about it but I know I need to.

I’m lucky i have a yard that is like my own personal national park so I can spend time outside but I refuse to wear headphones anymore when before they were basically attached to my head, I never wear my glasses in public so I can avoid making eye contact with people or at least pretend I don’t think anyone even sees me.

I literally have no reason to be like this, nothing has happened in my life to make me start thinking like this except moving to a new home MONTHS ago. I’m familiar with my area but not with the stores or anything because its completely new.

I spend extra money on getting groceries delivered but sometimes I need to go get bits and pieces. I find that I genuinely cannot leave my house without completely breaking down, my stomach gets so upset when I plan to leave my house alone that I just cant.

The last time I went to the grocery store alone was 2 months ago, maybe longer.

Its not ruining my life but if it continues it might, I’m a strong person and I can get through this but it’s a type of difficulty and will power that will drain me constantly.

I might try that freaky rejection therapy but not as intense, try to wear my glasses or go out more often. This is just tiring and really hard to explain to other people.","If it's this bad, I think you need medication. Or are you on any already? If not, did you think about it? 

And it would be really helpful if you'd managed to keep making very small steps out of your comfort zone on regular basis. Nothing that would feel terrifying.

I’m going to start taking baby steps, maybe go and see if I can drive myself to a local beach as its probably the least scary place to go.

I want to stress how important it is to make baby steps frequently. It helps far more than taking big steps once in a while. 

Also it would help if you engage in any other anxiety related behavior at home, like reassurance seeking, repeated checking or avoiding triggers, if you'd identify such behavior and then work on stopping it. As it's all connected, so working on one fear makes other fears weaker, too. 

And by medication I really meant an antidepressant, as that's what this is primarily treated with. To me it gave me my life back. Though I had more of an opposite problem, I was scared to stay in the house. Sort of had a phobia of my house you could say. But it should work for your problem, too."
Buspirone,"My psychiatrist prescribed me with buspirone (7.5 mg) a while ago and I’ve been hesitant to take it. I’ve been dealing with anxiety for the past month because of my hyperthyroidism and it’s been affecting my daily life a lot especially at work. My concern with buspirone is if it’s safe to take with lexapro together and if I will get any withdrawal effects if I stop taking buspirone despite the low dosage once my thyroid stabilizes and my anxiety goes away? 

","your psyc prescribed it so it’s safe with your lexapro. My personal experience with it was bad, i felt out of it and more depressed and anxious. i only took it for 2 days so take it with a grain of salt"

Was wondering if anyone would be able to share their experience on Mirtazapine. Just started it, 2nd day in, and I feel like an absolute zombie.

Im on 15mg currently. ","It was the same for me , helped me sleep though. It dies down after a few weeks. Im on 30. Its never the same as it was before, theres a deliberate sedating effect to that AD."

Can’t scream this enough mirtazapine are the best I’ve had.,,"I've been fighting anxiety for 22 years. For the first year I was on mirtazipine because I thought I was just having really bad insomnia. It got my sleep under control and after a year I stopped using it and my sleep stayed normal.

But my anxiety only got worse, so we tried Zoloft and that started a 20 year period of experimenting because all SSRIs seem to turn me into a zombie of sorts. It fixes my anxiety, but strips all the color from my life, leaves me unmotivated and completely uninterested in doing anything productive.

I've tried every SSRI/SNRI and many, many, many side-pills to try and counter the effects of the first. With no luck.

This year, somehow I ended up having a doctor suggest mirtazipine because my sleep schedule had gone back to being disrupted every night.

And it's worked, but far more than sleeping, it's actually given me back all that color I lost. Well, it's too early now to say for sure, this could easily be a temporary thing. But it's been about 6 weeks so far and the difference in my life has been dramatic. Almost too good to be real.

But yeah, agreeing with op, this seems to be a far more capable medicine than I realised the first time I used it."

Are there any common anti-anxiety meds that are liquid, chewable or similar formats?","There are Clonazepam drops (I guess possibly other benzos too), I'm not sure if ketamine can be prescribed for anxiety but it helps and is available in nasal sprays. Probably really expensive tho. If you're scared of swallowing, there are benzos that can be taken sublingually. 

Uhm idk if I'd recommend benzos unless the case is severe, but those are the options I've heard of."

Are there any common anti-anxiety meds that are liquid, chewable or similar formats?","I’ve used CBD oils with concentrations ranging from 10% to 30% from the brand Eusphera during moments of anxiety or stress. They’ve helped me feel more relaxed and calm. I also use them to sleep better, helping me avoid waking up frequently during the night and making it easier to fall asleep. What I find most valuable is that, being natural, they are gentle on the body and the digestive system, which makes them easy to use as part of my routine. I don’t see a psychologist because my anxiety isn’t severe, but after discussing it with my doctor, I was advised to try this kind of product."
Hypnotherapy ,Does anyone have experience with hypnotherapy for removing irrational fears? ,Yes 👍
Hypnotherapy ,Does anyone have experience with hypnotherapy for removing irrational fears? ,Seems like it worked well for you. May I ask what kind of fears? Like ocd or fobias? And what kind of hypnotherapy?
Hypnotherapy ,Does anyone have experience with hypnotherapy for removing irrational fears? ,Had an experience that would trigger my anxiety via intrusive thoughts that happened when I was younger. My therapist tried hypnotherapy on me and it took no longer than 2 mins. I don’t know the science but that intrusive thought or anxiety has never returned regarding that trigger

Holiday traveling dread,"Every single year I dread the travel and expense that come with traveling but I feel so guilty even thinking of just spending Christmas alone and saving myself the stress.

My only family that I speak with is my sisters and they live on the other side of the country. I do not have my license but even if I did it would be at least an 8 hour drive. So I fly. But my work only got their holiday schedule today and the domestic airport flights are way too expensive so this year I would probably have to travel to an airport at least 2 hours away.

I’m just so tired of taking Ubers and flying and taking Ubers and flying and it all gives me so much anxiety. However me and my sister have already talked about me staying with her like usual and she always look forward to me visiting. But honestly every year I dread Christmas due to this.

I also have a lot of anxiety about money so spending so much money on flights and long Uber drives irks me so much. Plus thinking about my safety keeps me stressed because I do t feel entirely comfortable taking such long Uber or shuttle rides with strangers.

I feel so bad because my sister also doesn’t speak with our parents anymore and if I choose not to go she might be alone for the holidays as well. She’s also moving to a new place that she’s a bit unsure about and thinking of her being alone there and sad really hurts.

I just feel really upset/guilty right now and a little strange because I really wouldn’t mind spending the holidays alone. I feel like the holidays don’t even feel like a holiday and that I am not prioritizing the little precious family I have left.

I just want to cry and disappear at the thought of everything. I’m not sure what I will decide to do but I feel either way I’ll feel terrible. If I had someone to travel with I don’t think I would feel as scared about the traveling part at least. 

Just writing this to vent and get it off my chest so I can sleep.","You need to do what feels right for you.

There comes a time in life where we have to put ourselves first. 

Can your sisters come to you instead?"

PVC and suspected AFib caused by anxiety,"after multiple ER visits and stays at the hospital and 2 holter monitors i can see it clearly and confidently stress or GAD in my case can cause PVC's and might lead to AFIB.
Taking the anxiety medicine stops everything.","Are you sure about your logic?  Anxiety on its own does not cause AFib, but it may exacerbate it if you have it or already predisposed to AFib.  Do you have some predisposition? 

Logic is more sound with PVC, anxiety CAN cause this but...most people don't notice when it happens, though.

Key is to get anxiety under control.  It's good to rule things out with a Holter monitor.  Take what anxiety meds are necessary for you.  PVC and AFib are bad news, if you can keep them away by managing anxiety, this is probably the route you want to go.

Talk with YOUR doctor about it.  I'm not YOUR doctor.  Good luck, OP."

Taking the anxiety medicine stops everything.","This is not correct. Your stress and anxiety is triggering PVC’s. it’s probably giving you more anxiety too, and ultimately increasing them. Your heart is still set up to have PVC’s. (and PVC’s do not necessarily lead to afib). Or else everyone who has anxiety would have PVC’s - but they don’t."

but how come do PVC and AFIB disappear when i take my anxiety meds. and they dont come back until my meds wear off and im anxious again.
btw i found a study where they gave people with anxiety and afib a device to record when they have their afib and what happened right before it in some thing like 90 percent anxiety triggered the afib.
another thing i noticed is that when anxiety hits the pvc's go crazy usually people don't notice this because you feel nothing and when there is alot of close pvc's afib probability increases."

I have a very embarrassing problem called monophobia ,"I am an adult. 44 years old. I know I have generalized anxiety disorder with a “focus” on health anxiety, a little bit of flying anxiety and my situational “being home alone” anxiety AKA monophobia.

I am never alone except when my spouse leaves for a business trip or a trip when he accompanies his elderly parents out of state (cannot drive and fly solo anymore). There are times when we can’t go together because my child has school so I stay home. Even being home with my pre-teen scares me. I have become completely dependent on my husband (I don’t have to be close to him all the time, the fact that he’s home makes me feel more comfortable). I can leave the house alone, I can be out alone, I can travel alone, I just cannot be HOME alone. 

In a couple of months, he needs to go out of state for 4 days. And I am already freaking out about it. Anyone else with this type of anxiety?

TLDR: I am scared to be home alone. It sucks. Anyone else?",Have you tried any medication and exposure response therapy?

I have had therapy sessions before for my health anxiety. I can deal with this so much better now.

The thought of Exposure therapy for being alone scares me already. But I know it is the gold standard for dealing with this. I just feel like I am the only grown adult in the world who has this stupid fear."

Symptoms
The symptoms of obstructive and central sleep apneas overlap, sometimes making it difficult to determine which type you have. 

The most common symptoms of obstructive and central sleep apneas include:

Loud snoring.
Episodes in which you stop breathing during sleep — which would be reported by another person.
Gasping for air during sleep.
Awakening with a dry mouth.
Morning headache.
Difficulty staying asleep, known as insomnia.
Excessive daytime sleepiness, known as hypersomnia.
Difficulty paying attention while awake.
Irritability.

When to see a doctor
Loud snoring can indicate a potentially serious problem, but not everyone who has sleep apnea snores. Talk to your health care provider if you have symptoms of sleep apnea. Ask your provider about any sleep problem that leaves you fatigued, sleepy and irritable."

My mood didn’t feel any different though.  Doctor said it was my higher heart rate and the impact on my endocrine system increasing adrenaline levels in my blood, and the beta blocker would help."
My play by play for overcoming anxiety with symptoms ,"In my journey to overcome cardiophobia, it was a fine line  between admitting I was anxious  and then turning around and telling myself so what? Oh but you were gaslighting someone once said. Fair enough. But it’s one thing to feel a certain way, an irrational way, another to pay attention to that and let it influence what you believe. The fact is that by a certain point, you no longer believe there is danger, you’ve just come to fear and dread the feelings. There’s a difference between constantly trying to reassure yourself and reminding yourself of what you truly believe. Trying to reassure yourself just reinforces in your mind that you have doubt.  The relief is short lived. You wind up constantly having to seek reassurance. Instead decide what you believe. Instead ask yourself NOT WITH THE IDEA OF STOPPING SYMPTOMS OR FINDING RELIEF, “Do I really believe this is going to end badly? What happened the last hundred times? So what’s the most likely outcome on this occasion. Never mind what MIGHT happen some day, what will happen this time?” Don’t spend too much time on this trying to make symptoms go away. Be okay with not being okay knowing that as soon as you are no longer focused on it, it will go away on its own. In the meantime let it be there, but off to the side as you cheerfully defy and dismiss it, knowing it will fade as long as you don’t look at it too intently. Don’t fight or struggle with it, in other words. As your mind starts to see the positive end result more and more, the episodes will be shorter and less intense.
The goal should not be stop anxiety by denying it but lowering it by admitting it and choosing to do nothing. It's not a matter of trying. Trying is not good.
It's matter of letting go and leaving it alone. Don’t struggle trying not to think about it or be aware of it, it’s a delicate balance. Let your focus on it fade away. You don’t need effort, effort is struggle. It’s your attitude toward this you need to work on. The truth is it takes no work, it’s a quick reminder of your beliefs for the future without trying to accomplish anything now. Relief will come soon enough. For now, you can take it. It’s your mind, you don’t need your stupid reptilian brain to dictate your reality. Oh and by the way guess who fed it that reality? You did. Unintentionally of course. Remind yourself of this conviction you have. That there is no danger. Don’t spend any time convincing yourself or debating the topic. I’m telling you. I was there. You are safe. You can call it gaslighting, but you aren’t denying how you are feeling, you are just affirming what you believe. You decide that no matter what you feel physically or emotionally. When you seek relief through assurance and go back and forth, your real motive is to stop symptoms and anxiety. That’s not much of an assurance if you fear and dread it. A couple of times that you take any evasive action will make it fully entrenched. I got to the point where I would avoid  leaving the house, even though I could have easily tolerated it. Take a step back from that need for emotional and physical relief, that reassurance and watch things start to turn around. You have probably had to relearn this many times. So always remind yourself, “Oh that’s right, I decided I don’t believe in this any more” don’t monitor it looking for relief, or as I call it in my own mind “don’t linger there noticing it.” Don’t let your continuing to get symptoms make you think you need reassurance to make it go away. This will stop being a problem after you no longer see it as a problem. The symptoms will leave long afterward as long as you don’t fall back into the habit of seeing it as a problem. This is like a scab. If you pick at it and tear the scab off it will take longer to heal. Leave it alone. ","When you seek reassurance with the motive of making symptoms go away, that’s not much reassurance because it means you see symptoms as a threat and want to avoid them. Instead remind yourself of what you truly  belief deep down inside, that there is no threat. Your experience has probably shown this to be the case, or at least on this occasion you know that’s the more likely outcome. That takes no convincing, no matter how your body reacts or how you feel. You decide what you believe. Quickly remind yourself of that only once. It shouldn’t be about not getting symptoms. Expect symptoms  and accept them. Only then will they stop happening. None of us want it to be that way. We just want it to stop through some other means. Unfortunately, there are no short cuts. Accept and allow first, long enough for it to fade away. Don’t fall back in the hole. Don’t crawl back in your cage seeking safety the way I did. ."
My play by play for overcoming anxiety with symptoms ,"In my journey to overcome cardiophobia, it was a fine line  between admitting I was anxious  and then turning around and telling myself so what? Oh but you were gaslighting someone once said. Fair enough. But it’s one thing to feel a certain way, an irrational way, another to pay attention to that and let it influence what you believe. The fact is that by a certain point, you no longer believe there is danger, you’ve just come to fear and dread the feelings. There’s a difference between constantly trying to reassure yourself and reminding yourself of what you truly believe. Trying to reassure yourself just reinforces in your mind that you have doubt.  The relief is short lived. You wind up constantly having to seek reassurance. Instead decide what you believe. Instead ask yourself NOT WITH THE IDEA OF STOPPING SYMPTOMS OR FINDING RELIEF, “Do I really believe this is going to end badly? What happened the last hundred times? So what’s the most likely outcome on this occasion. Never mind what MIGHT happen some day, what will happen this time?” Don’t spend too much time on this trying to make symptoms go away. Be okay with not being okay knowing that as soon as you are no longer focused on it, it will go away on its own. In the meantime let it be there, but off to the side as you cheerfully defy and dismiss it, knowing it will fade as long as you don’t look at it too intently. Don’t fight or struggle with it, in other words. As your mind starts to see the positive end result more and more, the episodes will be shorter and less intense.

This is one of the most damaging things You can do, and it will burrow Your fear deeper and deeper into your subconscious. What You have explained feels like classic anxiety, health anxiety too.

I advise visiting a professional to assist you, a psychologist would do well. Work with them to the best of both of your capabilities, and You will do yourself a lot of good.

Whatever You do, do not engage in any compulsive behaviour, like research. Many symptoms of anxiety are akin to EXTREMELY horrible diseases, however it is merely a stress response in all of our cases here. If necessary, your professional will have You checked out physically, but do not fall into the habit of seeking medical reassurance otherwise, nor assurance from other people."

Do not fall into the common trap of percieving this as wrong. Be aware of it and deal with it.

I would maybe also not do the notes, but just go for straight journaling. It removes part of the focus from anxiety, allowing other, benevolent influences into Your life more, while also allowing You good introspection. This may help sort some issues You may have, consciously or otherwise. It is like a self-therapy session lite.

As previously mentioned, with anxiety, the sooner You start with a professional, the better. You can always refuse medication and stick to conversation and other types of non-medication therapy."

Should I start taking Medication for my anxiety?,"I've been a pretty anxious person my entire life but it's gotten worse in the past 2 years. It's the worst it's ever been since July as I started a new job. I'm going to therapy consistently, one session a week, working through CBT. I feel there's been some improvement; when I first started the job, I was so anxious I could barely function but now I'm able to eat and sleep much better than when I first started.  
  
However, I'm still living in a constant state of anxiety and some days, it's so bad, I can't think at all and I wake up in the middle of the night crying wishing I was in a better place. Some days I feel like the CBT is barely doing anything. I told my therapist this and she suggested I try medication. She recommend this before when I first started but I decided to try CBT first before immediately starting with medication.

Has anyone experienced this before? What are your thoughts on medication vs not? What are some of your experiences with medication? ","Most likely yes. My psychiatrist told me people usually need it if anxiety has been going on for longer than 6 months. Though in the end it's for a doctor to decide. But by the sound of it I'm confident a doctor would prescribe it. 

And I personally had a very good experience with medication. I tried everything before going on it and in the end only medication finally made me get better. I think CBT and also DBT can be good, but I don't think it can do too much if anxiety is this bad. CBT is more like slowly exercising after recovering from a serious injury. First you need a surgery, which in this analogy is the medication. And only then it's time for exercise."

I also use them to sleep better, helping me avoid waking up frequently during the night and making it easier to fall asleep. What I find most valuable is that, being natural, they are gentle on the body and the digestive system, which makes them easy to use as part of my routine. I don’t see a psychologist because my anxiety isn’t severe, but after discussing it with my doctor, I was advised to try this kind of product."

I've had some panic attacks during a show lately. It's terrible. I have to disconnect my brain from what I'm playing just to make it through the song. After a few minutes I'm okay, but it does take a toll on my nervous system. I've started taking hydroxyzine a few minutes before a show. It helps. I'm on 50 mg of Zoloft but the other helps immediately. You could take a Benadryl in a pinch and see if that will call you down. Good luck"
Anxious musician ,"It's been a while since I posted but I need some help. I'm a musician (drummer) and I've noticed I have extreme anxiety before I perform. 

Nowadays my band and I have been travelling to different states ( I'm from india) and it's been getting worse because I also have travel anxiety. It's been affecting quite a lot as I'm a diabetic as well and my sugars have been really high.

Does anyone know any tips I can use to calm myself down. Especially other fellow musicians",Propanolol may be worth a look

Does anyone know any tips I can use to calm myself down. Especially other fellow musicians","Hey, I’ve been drumming for 16 years and also have been suffering from anxiety my whole life. I experienced shakes before performances that could cause an earthquake, vomited, even bailed on performances even because my anxiety was so severe. Something that helped me was being mindful of why I was anxious in the first place. I’m a very experienced and skilled drummer, I have no reason to be afraid, so why did I get so nervous? The answer is simple, I didn’t have confidence in myself as a performer at all. I was so worried of messing up that it would tear me apart. So afraid of being judged, when in reality, it is a bit unrealistic to think that people will judge you for your performance mistakes. And if they do, they are not worthy of a second of your attention. Their judgement is likely a projection of how they feel about themselves, in the same way your anxiety about performing might be a projection of how you feel about yourself.

Repeated exposure helped me tremendously. The more I performed, and directed my anxious energy towards the music instead, really helped me move on from my performance anxiety. I would go on stage, close my eyes, shake my head so much my hair would obscure my view, play as hard and as fully committed as I could, and it was like I was the only person in the entire room. Forgetting about being perfect and absolutely immersing myself in the moment made me not only connect so much more with music, but also made me love performing so much more. Nowadays, I still get anxious and nervous before performing, but I find it incredibly exciting, and performing is the ultimate way of releasing that energy. Do it more, and focus on the music. Play like it is the last time you will ever play. Focus on every hit, the rhythm, the harmony of it all, and your fear will fade."

Having extreme anxiety & diabetes can go hand in hand. If I may ask, what is your diet nowadays? What do you typically eat?"

Learning the hard way ,Went out tonight and currently in my hotel with the worst heartburn and thinking I’m dying. I started a weight loss med a month ago and haven’t had any issues until tonight. Ate fried and greasy food and drank alcohol. Woke up in a cold sweat with terrible heartburn. So I start to spiral. Pacing my room wondering if I should wake my husband up. No blood pressure machine to make sure I’m really ok and didn’t get enough water. I have to be up in 4 hours. Just needed to vent. Definitely learning that I need to make some adjustments on this medication. Terrible way to start the holiday. ,"Fried & greasy food is the WORST anxiety trigger for me, especially if it causes heartburn… like you, I panic and pace the floors all night. You can drink some water, but don’t do too much at once. In my experience with this, I’ve always had to wait out the digestion process for it to finally go away. I’m sorry you’re going through this. I responded because I can relate, so you’re not feeling like you’re alone."

I was able to take my anxiety drugs and they made such a difference while I waited it all out. Definitely learned a lesson and took it much easier today. Still ate too much but took some antacid to help. Just trying to get through my trip.
